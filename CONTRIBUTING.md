# Contributing to Knit

Thanks for your interest in Knit — an offline, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted mesh messenger for
Android. Contributions are welcome, within the expectations below.

## Support expectations (read this first)

Knit is released **as-is** under the [GNU GPL v3.0-or-later](COPYING). It is developed on a
**best-effort, hobby basis**, with **no support, warranty, or response-time guarantee** of any kind —
this is the "NO WARRANTY" clause of the GPL, stated plainly:

- Issues and pull requests are welcome, but may not be triaged, answered, or accepted.
- There is **no commitment** to fix bugs, review contributions on any timeline, or maintain
  compatibility.
- Do not depend on Knit where failure matters. It is experimental software driving low-level radios.

If that works for you, read on.

## Ground rules

- **Be excellent to each other.** This project has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); by
  participating you agree to uphold it. Harassment or abuse is not welcome in issues, PRs, or discussions.
- **License:** by contributing, you agree your contribution is licensed under **GPL-3.0-or-later**, the
  same as the project.
- **Sign your commits (DCO):** add a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` trailer to each
  commit (`git commit -s`), certifying the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO) — the verbatim 1.1
  text, also published at [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/). The
  trailer's email must match the commit author's, and `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` opts
  into a repo hook that adds it for you. Only submit code you have the right to license under the
  GPL.
- **Third-party assets:** do not add dependencies or bundled models/data whose license is
  GPL-incompatible or unverified. The shipped dependency graph is intentionally GMS-free and
  Apache/BSD/MIT-only; keep it that way, and when you add or remove a shipped dependency update both
  [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) and the matching row in
  `app/src/main/java/app/getknit/knit/legal/ThirdPartyNotices.kt` (the in-app Open-source licenses list).
  `ThirdPartyNoticesSyncTest` and `ReleaseClasspathNoticesTest` fail until the table, the list and
  `app/gradle.lockfile` agree, and name the coordinate that is missing.

## Development

The single source of truth for build/test commands, the (deliberately bleeding-edge) toolchain, the
mesh architecture, and the hard-won gotchas is **[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)** — start there before touching
build config, the mesh layer, or the DI graph. In short:

- **JDK 21** and the Android SDK (compileSdk 37.1) are required.
- `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` — fast compile check of main sources.
- `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` — JVM unit tests (mesh/protocol/data, Robolectric Room).
- `./gradlew detekt ktlintCheck` — static analysis and style (`ktlintFormat` autocorrects).
- Real mesh behavior needs **two or more physical devices** — see the README's *Running* section.
- After any dependency change, regenerate the lockfile with
  `./gradlew :app:dependencies --write-locks` (see `AGENTS.md`).

Please run the unit tests, `detekt`, and `ktlintCheck` before opening a pull request, and match the
surrounding code style.

`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` opts into the repo's hooks — a `prepare-commit-msg` that adds
the DCO sign-off, a `commit-msg` that strips agent session-link trailers, and a `pre-commit` that
refuses an ADR commit whose generated router is out of sync, plus Git LFS's four hooks. That setting
replaces `.git/hooks` wholesale, so anything you keep there stops running; `git commit --no-verify`
skips them for one commit.

The Compose preview screenshot references (`app/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/`) are stored in
Git LFS — the only files that are. Building the app does not need it; running or updating the
screenshot tests does: install git-lfs, then `git lfs install && git lfs pull`.

## Where to submit

Development and contributions happen on GitHub at <https://github.com/getknit/knit>. Open issues and
pull requests there; the issue and pull-request templates will guide you through what to include. Keep
each pull request focused on a single change with a clear description of what and why.

A DCO job checks that every commit in a pull request carries a sign-off whose email matches its
author; if it fails, `git rebase --signoff origin/main` and a force-push fix the whole branch at
once. The rest of CI mirrors the maintainer's internal GitLab pipeline (build, unit tests, the ADR
and generated-asset sync checks); `detekt`/`ktlintCheck` ride along as advisory.

## Security

**Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public issues or pull requests. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for private disclosure.
