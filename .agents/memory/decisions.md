# Architecture decision records

The load-bearing decisions and *why* they hold, so future work stays consistent. One
file each, in [`decisions/`](decisions/) — this page is the router. Open the file whose
row matches; don't guess from the title alone. Supersede by writing a new ADR and
changing the old one's `Status:` — never by deleting it.

**This file is generated. Do not edit it by hand.** Add a decision with
`python3 scripts/adr.py new "<title>" --topics a,b`, write the body, then
`python3 scripts/adr.py index`.

**Two id forms, and both are permanent.** ADRs `001`-`067` predate the split into
one-file-per-decision and keep their sequence numbers, because `ADR NNN` is cited ~815
times in code comments, `docs/` and commit messages — including commits F-Droid pins,
which cannot be rewritten. Everything since is `YYYY-MM.suffix` (`ADR 2026-08.k3f9`),
minted at random, because the sequence number was itself the merge conflict: parallel
worktrees all read the same "next number" and all took it. Cite whichever form an ADR
carries; never renumber an old one.
