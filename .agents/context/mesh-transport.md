# Mesh transport (radios, NAN concurrency, BLE scan) — gotchas that have already bitten us

Deep behaviour of the two-radio transport. The **import-boundary rule** (keep `android.net.wifi.aware.*`
in `mesh/wifiaware/`, `android.bluetooth.*` in `mesh/bluetooth/`) lives in `rules/mesh.md`. This file
is the hard-won operational detail behind that seam.

## Per-peer responders DON'T compose — use one persistent accept-any responder

The intuitive design (each incoming peer gets its own
`WifiAwareNetworkSpecifier.Builder(session, peerHandle).setPort(...)` responder + `ServerSocket`) works
for *two* devices but silently fails for a third: a device already acting as responder for one peer
cannot stand up a second per-peer responder, so a phone joining an existing pair is stranded (its client
`requestNetwork` just times out; verified — 7 couldn't join an 8+9 pair). The fix in
`WifiAwareTransport`: each node runs **one** responder built from its *publish* session with **no peer
handle** (`WifiAwareNetworkSpecifier.Builder(publishSession).setPort(port)`), which accepts a data path
from **any** initiator over a single `ServerSocket`; all clients share it. Because an accept-any
responder doesn't know who connected, the **initiator sends its advert as the first
`LinkFraming.Type.HELLO` record** over the socket (`mesh/link/LinkHandshake`, shared with BLE), and the
responder reads it to identify the peer. Tie-break gives one link per pair (larger nodeId =
client/initiator, smaller = server). The responder is anchored to the publish session, so **only
*subscribe* is ever re-armed** (publish/responder stay up), respecting the "one data interface" rule
below.

## One NAN data interface (`maxNdiInterfaces == 1`) → one aware *network* at a time → cue-driven ephemeral sync

The single hardest constraint, confirmed on Pixel 7/8/9 (`dumpsys wifiaware` → `maxNdiInterfaces=1`) —
but the limit is **per-role**, not "one NDP, period" (re-audited on-device 2026-07-04; evidence +
corrected model in `docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md`): every **initiator** `requestNetwork` is its own
aware Network and needs its own NDI, so a second concurrent *initiate* is refused with
`WifiAwareDataPathStMgr: ... NdpInfos[] - no interfaces available!` (verified: Pixel 7, largest, couldn't
reach Pixel 9 while linked to Pixel 8) — while the **accept-any responder is ONE network that officially
multiplexes many concurrent inbound NDPs** on the same NDI (E1: 30+ consecutive serves on one request
with zero re-attaches; E2: two *simultaneous* inbound NDPs; firmware budget `maxNdpSessions=8`; the
`dumpsys` `mMaxNdpInApp=1` once read as a per-app cap is a metrics high-water mark, not a limit). Each
node's *outbound* is still single, so "everyone links to everyone they're larger than" still can't work,
and the shipped design runs **two planes** (a concurrent-serve redesign is proposed in
`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md` §5):

- **Coordination plane** — Wi-Fi Aware *messages* (`DiscoverySession.sendMessage` / `onMessageReceived`,
  ~255 B, best-effort, `maxQueuedTransmitMessages=8`) ride discovery follow-up frames and need **no data
  path**, so they reach every neighbor at once *and* keep working while the one NDP is busy. Each node
  cues `nodeId|version` — a `StoreDigest` **content digest** (XOR over its **live** custody frame-id set, so
  it is O(1)-incremental and **restart-stable**: same store ⇒ same version, unlike the old monotone
  `SyncEpoch` counter it replaced; expired-but-unswept rows are excluded, folded out **lazily** by
  `StoreDigest.current()` at every read/cue — expiry is frame-global `sentAt + TTL`, so all nodes flip
  together modulo clock skew instead of diverging for up to a sweep period, work item #8) — and
  `DigestTracker` (pure, JVM-tested) flags a peer *sync-wanted* when either side's digest changed since
  the last sync (an identical-digest pair skips the NDP entirely). Small floodable frames (broadcast
  chat, reactions, receipts, group-meta, profiles) *also* ride this plane as a best-effort **fast
  fan-out** (`fastFanout`/`fastSend`), deduped by the receiver's `SeenSet`, so they propagate with zero
  NDP. The framing is chosen **per peer** (`mesh/link/FastFramePick`, from the SSI-advert capability copy):
  toward a `CAP_FRAME_TRANSCODE` peer the frame rides the transcoded `0x05` tag (`mesh/link/FrameTranscoder`,
  ADR 060 — `signed` re-encoded with integer labels and raw ids, rebuilt byte-exact at the receiver before
  the signature is verified; the signed v3 ✓✓ tick is one 221-B message this way) or `0x03` when that is
  smaller; toward a `CAP_FAST_COMPACT` peer the compact `0x03` tag (`mesh/link/FastFrameCodec` — outer
  envelope stripped to 3 B + preset-dict deflate over `signed`, sig/signed byte-exact); either splits into
  ≤3 `0x04` fragments when one ~255 B message won't hold it (this is what lets AckSync's sealed ticks,
  sealed reactions, and full profiles ride at all — they measure 374-554 B legacy, see
  `CoordinationPlaneSizeBudgetTest`); toward legacy/cue-only peers the old `0x01` tagged-CBOR framing is
  kept, so no wire break. Counters: `fastCompactSent`/`fastTranscodedSent`/`fastLegacySent`/`fastFragSent`/
  `fastReassembled`/`fastTooBig`/`transcodeFallbacks`/`fastDropsByReason` on `…debug.STATE`; grep
  `fast-fanout`/`fast-send`/`fast-frame` logcat lines for per-frame routing. A cue also bootstraps
  the reverse handle, so a node whose own *subscribe* is broken (e.g. Pixel 9 post-kill) still cues
  larger peers to pull from it. A fast frame is a **sighting of the hop that delivered it, never of its
  author** — `NanHopTable` maps the (session, `PeerHandle`) a message arrived on to the node the last
  cue/advert named there, and that hop is what `noteReachable` and `InboundFrame.fromNodeId` get. The
  envelope's `senderId` is the originator (relays keep the signed bytes verbatim), and every node re-fans each
  first-seen custody frame, so crediting it put a peer miles away — and a BLE-only phone with no Aware
  radio — in the "directly connected" list for the 150 s linger (ADR 061). An unnamed handle is no
  sighting at all.
- **Data plane** — one ephemeral NDP, brought up **only** when a peer is sync-wanted (the larger id
  initiates, via the unchanged `initiateTo` + accept-any responder). On link-up each side advertises the
  custody ids it holds (a `LinkFraming.Type.DIGEST` record) and pushes back only the frames the peer lacks
  (`ForwardSync.onDigest`, replacing the old push-all backfill), then the NDP is torn down on
  **quiescence** (no data for `QUIESCENCE_MS`, never mid-file) — freeing the NDI for the next pair. The
  initiator drives teardown and records the sync in `DigestTracker` (it alone consults it); the responder
  just sees the socket close, with a longer `RESPONDER_MAX_HOLD_MS` safety cap for a dead initiator.

Net: an **idle mesh does zero data-path work** (just beacons + occasional cues); a new message triggers a
targeted sync with only the peers that need it; and everything stays delay-tolerant (store-and-forward
custody carries what one flood doesn't reach — a rotating series of pairwise syncs propagates
epidemically). Single-slot admission (`beginConnect`/`beginAccept`: at most one link/handshake/accept,
plus a `SETTLE_MS` gap after a link ends so the NDI is released before the next `requestNetwork`) keeps
the radio off the "no interfaces available" wedge. `discoveryLoop`/`rearmSubscribe()` re-fire one-shot
discovery **only while the slot is free** (never with a live NDP, whose client side rides the subscribe
session and would be dropped by a re-arm).

## A lonely node relaxes its discovery cadence (ADR 2026-09.kb68)

With no cue targets `NanSyncPolicy.needsRediscovery` is true on every tick (an empty snapshot is "blind"), so
the loop re-armed subscribe every `REARM_COOLDOWN_MS` for as long as the phone was alone, and every re-arm
relights Instant Communication Mode for the framework's 30 s — a phone in a drawer kept ICM lit around the
clock. `mesh/wifiaware/NanLonelyPolicy` gives the loop its cadence while lonely: the old 8 s / 15 s for the
first three minutes and whenever the screen is on or the charger is in, then — the shared
`PowerPolicy.lonelyRelaxed` rule, "alone ≥ 3 min on battery", which the BLE scan also reads — the duty
cycle's base interval as the tick (120 s / 300 s) with the cooldown 15 s under it (ICM 25 % / 10 %). The
screen-on exception is NAN's own since ADR 2026-09.w3xk (the shared rule stopped carrying it when the BLE scan
learned to relax a screen-on node): a 30 s tick would leave ICM at ~100 %, so a relaxed interactive cadence
here needs its own tick and a trial — deferred, and `NanLonelyPolicyTest` pins the clause. `lonelySince` is observed by the loop, never maintained at
the cue-target removal sites; it resets on `onAttached` and on a BLE sighting of a peer we hold no cue target
for (`onForeignReachable` rising edge, which also pokes the loop). `heal()` buys exactly one re-arm at the
aggressive cooldown (`healRearmOwed`), so walking re-arms once per motion trigger. Nothing else in the loop
changes: branch order, the watchdog's clocks, the sync and ICM-relight paths all read as before, and every
wedge the file guards against needs an owed peer to be observed, which a lonely node has none of. Oracles:
`re-arm subscribe (lonely=…ms cooldown=…ms heal=…)` and `lonely: relaxed …` / `lonely: aggressive again` on
the transport tag, `lonely=` on the state line. The device trial is listed in the ADR and still owed.

## `requestNetwork` with no timeout leaks the one interface forever — always time-box it

The 3-arg `requestNetwork(request, cb, handler)` has no timeout, so a request that can't be fulfilled
stays pending forever — its `NetworkCallback` never unregisters and its NDI reservation never frees, so
the node exhausts its single interface and can never connect again (observed: a Pixel 7 stuck in a
`terminate: already terminated` loop). Always use the **timeout** overload
`requestNetwork(req, cb, handler, HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS)`, clean up in `onUnavailable`, and back a failed
peer off (`CONNECT_BACKOFF_MS`) so a different sync-wanted peer gets the slot next. Note `neighbors` is the
≤1 live link (send routing + the `onNeighborAdded` sync hooks); the **UI reads the smoothed `reachable`
set** (coordination-plane sightings, lingered `REACHABLE_LINGER_MS`) so it doesn't blink as ephemeral
syncs come and go.

The accept-any **responder** request is the one request that is *not* time-boxed — it stands for the life
of the publish session — and its `onUnavailable` is the framework declaring it unfulfillable and dropping
it from its cache. `refileResponder` re-files it on `NanResponderPolicy`'s terms (ADR 2026-09.bgk3): a
verdict while a link, handshake or accept of ours is live (or inside `SETTLE_MS`) is the documented knock
refusal — the interface really was busy — and is re-filed after a 500 ms floor without being counted; a
verdict with the interface free is about the request, backs off along 0.5 → … → 60 s, and at five in a
row gives the request up for `sessionCycleWithSettle()`, three cycles per episode, refunded only by the
responder's `onAvailable`. Before this the re-file was immediate and the Pixel 3 filed 174 in 130 ms
(work item #77). Never count the contended case: a hub serving a long sync collects knocks for the life
of the link.

## An initiate that knocks the phone off its Wi-Fi is given up on (ADR 2026-09.m8kc)

On the Pixel 3 (blueline, API 31) every NDP we initiate ends in a firmware REJECT that also tears the phone's
own STA down (`DEAUTH_LEAVING`, eight drops in two hours, band-independent), and each drop silently kills the
Aware client; the request never reaches the peer (a byte-swapped publish id inside `system_server`). The
largest node id initiates to everyone and `NanConnectPolicy` never gives up, so that was a Wi-Fi drop a minute.
`mesh/wifiaware/NanInitiatorPolicy` (pure, JVM-tested) is the failsafe: the transport keeps a **passive**
`registerNetworkCallback` on `TRANSPORT_WIFI`, a loss followed by an available within 15 s is a **blip**, and a
blip whose loss fell within 120 s *after* an initiate of ours with no link since is a **strike** — never a
`NanConnectPolicy` streak (the P7/P8/P9 fleet runs long streaks against a wedged responder with no STA harm).
Three strikes **hold the initiator role**: `driveSync` stops initiating, and the responder, discovery, cues and
the fast plane keep running, so nearby phones still connect to this one and Bluetooth carries custody. The hold
acts through **one choke point** — `digestSyncWanted` / `bulkSyncWanted`, where the BLE `suppressed` set already
lives — so every admission *and* recovery site (the wedge watchdog's owed clock included; Tier-2 is a process
kill, and the hold is journaled) stops seeing a sync it would have to initiate; `PeerFacts.initiator` stays the
tie-break so `needsIcmRelight` is unaffected; `expectBulkTransfer` refuses a held peer so a photo goes to BLE
without the composite's 10 s grace. Refunded by **exactly one** field event — an initiator link forming —
plus the user's "Try again" (Diagnostics, `MeshTransport.releaseInitiatorHold()` through the controller and
composite) and the build+ROM stamp (`data/settings/NanInitiatorJournal`, the ADR 055 shape). Never by the Aware
edge, `heal()`, `stop()` or a fresh session; `pause()` and a genuine Aware-off void the initiate in flight as
not evidence, but our own session cycle's NAN-down does not (on the Pixel 3 that cycle is bgk3's recovery from
the very drop being judged). A held role takes **one probe initiate a day** (wall clock, journaled) through
`driveSync` alone — `syncWantedForProbe`; the recovery sites keep the held view. Surface:
`MeshTransport.initiatorHeld` → `TransportStatus.initiatorHeld` → an "on hold" tag and a section under
Transports; `TransportHealth` unchanged, the plane is healthy. Oracles on the transport tag: `Wi-Fi dropped and
came back … — strike n/3`, `holding the initiator role`, `daily initiator probe`, `initiator link formed under
the hold — releasing it`; `init=` on the state line; `…debug.NANINIT` (`context/debug-bridge.md`).

Device-verified 2026-09-19 on the P3 (the ADR has the log): one natural strike through the real `NetworkCallback`
(the drop is rarer than the issue's night — 1 in 26 initiates), two injected, the hold, a force-stop restore, the
forced probe and its `AlreadyHeld` verdict, the Diagnostics tag + section, and "Try again now". Two traps for the
next run: the P3 in deep Doze without the battery exemption has Aware **disabled by the framework**
(`dumpsys wifiaware` → `mUsageEnabled: false`, Knit reads `Unavailable`) — lift Doze first; and a real STA drop
takes network adb with it, so a `logcat` pipe dies at exactly the moment you want it — loop the reconnect. Still
owed: the initiator-link refund on hardware (needs a phone that can actually link), and the P9-side injected leg.

## The coordination plane can die while discovery lives, and only a NAN restart brings it back (ADR 2026-09.jjhg)

Work item #81, from `soak-20260921-bursts`. After a chat burst a phone's Wi-Fi Aware follow-up plane — the cue
heartbeat and the fast path, `DiscoverySession.sendMessage` — stops being acked: `nanMsgsAcked` flat,
`nanMsgSendsFailed` climbing by the whole send rate, for hours, while `onServiceDiscovered` keeps re-firing,
`disc`/`reach` stay full, `live=[]`, health `Healthy`. The frozen phone receives no follow-ups either. Chat is
unaffected (Bluetooth and the side channel carry it) so nothing alarms. Two mechanisms, both in the forensics:

- **The framework's send queue deadlocks.** `WifiAwareStateManager` blocks on a firmware `FOLLOWUP_TX_QUEUE_FULL`
  but arms its 10 s timeout only off messages it still tracks; with none tracked nothing unblocks. The next 50
  sends from our uid get **no callback at all**, every send after that fails instantly. `dumpsys wifiaware`:
  `mSendQueueBlocked: true`, `mFwQueuedSendMessages: [{}]`, 50 host-queued.
- **The firmware stops delivering unicast.** Queue idle; every follow-up queued successfully and failed ~4 s
  later, including to a peer matched seconds earlier under its current address. Not a stale `PeerHandle`.

Both clear on a **NAN restart** and on nothing else the app can do. Knit is the only Aware client on the lab
Pixels, so `session.close()` is the framework's last-client detach (`onAwareDownCleanupSendQueueState()` + a
firmware disable/enable with a fresh address); every recovery in the run followed one (a Doze NAN-down, a
`reattach()`, a session cycle), and the phone that never restarted stayed frozen five hours. Addresses do not
rotate on the 30-minute `mac_random_interval_sec`; they change only on a restart — which also means a peer's
restart leaves our publish-side handle to it pointing at a dead address until it messages us again.

`checkMessagePlane` (every `WEDGE_CHECK_MS`, beside `checkWedge`) reads the ack bookkeeping `sendCoord` keeps —
every send by `messageId` until the framework answers, the last ack, failures since it, the last sighting — and
`NanMessagePlanePolicy` gives one of two verdicts: **swallowed** (oldest unanswered send ≥ 30 s old, no ack since)
or **starved** (≥ 4 failures since the last ack, no ack for 60 s, a peer sighted within 90 s — the sighting is
what separates a dead plane from a peer that walked away, which is pruned at 150 s). The cure is Tier 1's
`sessionCycleWithSettle()` on the shared `lastReattachAt` cooldown, 3 per episode, never with a live link, and
the episode ends only on an ack that lands after it began — not on the cycle, not on the beat its NAN-down
leaves the node unhealthy and alone (ADR 2026-09.9dnk's livelock). A spent episode earns a fresh set after 15
minutes. Read it on a device from `…debug.STATE`'s `nanMsgPlaneStalledPeakMs` / `nanMsgPlaneCycles`, the state
line's `msg=<unanswered>/<failsSinceAck>/<sinceAck>`, and `…debug.NANMSG`; `dumpsys wifiaware`'s
`mSendQueueBlocked` tells the two mechanisms apart. Trap: a send on a discovery session we have closed is a
silent no-op in the framework (no callback ever) — `sendCoord` refuses it and `rearmSubscribe` forgets what the
closed subscribe strands; record one as in flight and it reads as swallowed forever.

## Three sets, and only one of them means *nearby*

`MeshTransport.neighbors` is live links; `MeshTransport.reachable` is sightings. Above the composite the
split is different and easy to get backwards (ADR 2026-09.2ajk):

- **`MeshController.neighbors` = `CompositeMeshTransport.shortRangeReachable`** — the merged `reachable`
  set restricted to children whose `MeshTransport.shortRange` is true. This is what every *nearby* /
  *online* / *connected* surface reads: the foreground notification count, the chat-list status row, the
  Contacts online dot, Profile Details, the group member picker, and Diagnostics' *Directly connected*.
  Only a short-range plane sights the peer's **own** radio.
- **`MeshController.reachable`** — the full union, long-range planes included. A superset, read only by
  Diagnostics' *Reachable long-range*. A LoRa entry names the plane a frame arrived over, not proximity
  and not the peer's hardware: LoRa keys presence on the frame *author*, and a gateway carries other
  people's frames, so a phone with no board at all appears here (`context/lora-bridge.md`).
- **`MeshController.shortRangeKinds`** — which `TransportKind`s count as short-range, read off
  `MeshTransport.shortRange` rather than restated, so a UI telling a proximity tag from a relay one
  cannot drift from what the transports declare.

Adding a plane is where this bites: give it `shortRange = false` unless a sighting really does mean the
peer is in radio range, or every *nearby* surface in the app inherits the claim.

## Wi-Fi Aware availability flaps, and may be absent entirely

`WifiAwareManager.isAvailable()` goes false when Wi-Fi is off or **another app's** Wi-Fi Direct / SoftAP /
hotspot seizes the radio; the transport watches `ACTION_WIFI_AWARE_STATE_CHANGED`, flips `health` to
`Degraded`, tears links down, and re-attaches on recovery. **It does not go false for our own P2P.** Since
Android 12 `HalDeviceManager` gives same-app interface requests equal priority, so they never evict each
other: Knit's own `createGroup` returns `BUSY` while our Aware session is attached, and `isAvailable()`
stays true throughout. There is no edge to react to, which is why the direct-transfer path pauses this
transport by hand (`MeshTransport.pause`/`resume`, `context/direct-transfer.md`, ADR 2026-09.wtmz). `PackageManager.FEATURE_WIFI_AWARE` can be missing outright
(some budget/older + certain Samsung models) — but the **Bluetooth LE plane still meshes** on those
devices, since `CompositeMeshTransport` merges whichever radios are present, so the UI shows the
"unsupported" state only when *neither* Wi-Fi Aware nor BLE hardware exists
(`RadioSupport.probe(context).any`, in onboarding). The same verdict (`mesh/RadioSupport.kt`: `PlaneSupport`
Supported / NoHardware / NeedsAndroid12, the two transports' `isSupported` gates are expressed on it) fills in
the Diagnostics Transports row for a plane the composite never built — "Not supported by this phone" or "Needs
Android 12 or newer" — since an omitted row had looked identical to a radio switched off (work item 18). Never
as a synthetic `TransportStatus`: the chat list's `radioWarningFor` reads every entry there as present hardware.

## On API 29–32 publish/subscribe are location-gated, and the service's type is what lifts it (ADR 2026-09.535d)

`WifiAwareServiceImpl` enforces the **location app-op** on `publish` and `subscribe` only — `attach`,
`updatePublish`, `sendMessage` and `requestNetwork` are not gated — and a "While using the app" grant is a
foreground-only app-op, so a backgrounded uid is refused with `SecurityException: UID … does not have
Coarse/Fine Location permission`. What lifts it is the `location` **runtime** foreground-service type
(`meshForegroundServiceTypes`, tiered with `requiredRadioPermissions`; the manifest attribute alone grants
nothing), and on 30–32 also the while-in-use flag the system grants only to a start from a visible activity —
which `KnitApp`'s resume observer makes on every open. Until then a boot- or sticky-started service still
discovers only on screen. The transport tells that refusal from a dead client (`NanSessionFault.classify`,
tier-gated), **holds** it as `TransportHealth.ForegroundOnly` with nothing torn down (the publish, the
responder and every NDP keep serving) and retries once per `heal()`; routing it through `onSessionDead`
instead is the 45-attaches-in-four-minutes churn of work item #62, against `NanAttachPolicy`'s leak budget.
From 33 discovery rides `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` and none of this applies.

## One file streams at a time per socket

`mesh/link/LinkFraming` (transport-neutral — the same codec runs over the Wi-Fi Aware NDP socket and the
BLE L2CAP socket) multiplexes frames + files over one connected byte stream; the writer serializes file
transfers and interleaves live frames *between* chunks (so an 8 MiB blob never stalls traffic), which is
why a `FILE_HEADER`→`FILE_CHUNK`s→`FILE_END` run needs no file id. Don't push two files down one socket
expecting them to interleave.

A link holds **at most one custody digest waiting to be written** (ADR 2026-09.tjfb). `FramedLink.sendDigest`
swaps the ids into one slot and queues a `DigestDue` marker only when the slot was empty; the writer empties
the slot when it reaches the marker. A digest is a snapshot of `liveIds`, so the newer set replaces the older
one where it stands, and a back-fill on a slow link no longer collects one stale 20 KB digest per re-offer
tick in `FramedLink`'s queue. An idle link's cadence and bytes are unchanged, and a digest still rides between
file chunks. Counter: `digestsReplaced`. Sender-local: the wire and the receiver are untouched. **It reaches
only `FramedLink`'s own queue:** the Bluetooth stack's socket buffer (≥ 120 KB on the Pixel 3) holds whatever
the writer has already handed it, and on the knit-ios `hci1` rig a post still waited 133 s behind six digests
queued there (393 s behind ten before). Shrinking that wait means keeping the socket shallow or the digest
smaller, not a second slot.

## Steady-state digest parity + BLE suppression means NAN has no NDP exactly when an image needs it

Large attachments go through the bulk-want escape hatch, and it must never feed the recovery machinery.
With both radios up, BLE holds the link, the composite suppresses NAN's sync to that peer
(`suppressDataPath`), and converged custody digests make `reconcileWanted` false — so
`childHoldingLinkTo` only ever finds BLE and a naive "prefer NAN in `sendFile`" silently falls back
~always, leaving images to crawl over untuned L2CAP. The fix: `CompositeMeshTransport.sendFile`
(ATTACHMENT only; any size rides an already-live NAN link, and one ≥ `BULK_MIN_BYTES` = 128 KiB also
arms a bring-up — the gate compares the **transcoded wire blob**, not the user's source file: a 1-5 MB
GIF lands at ~150-250 KB as a 480px q70 animated WebP, which is how the original 256 KiB gate quietly
routed "large GIFs" over BLE) and `MeshManager.deliverChat` (at `blobExchange.want`) call
`MeshTransport.expectBulkTransfer` on **both** sides of the pair — the requester marks the author, the
serving side marks the requester; only the larger nodeId can initiate, so whichever side that is has a
mark — which arms a TTL'd `BulkWantTracker` that `WifiAwareTransport.syncWanted` ORs in ahead of the
suppression + digest gates. The split is load-bearing: the bulk term reaches ONLY the admission sites
(`driveSync`/`initiateOwed`/`initiateOwedToReachable`), while `anyReachableSyncOwed` (the wedge watchdog's
owed clock — Tier-2 is a process kill), `needsRediscovery` (subscribe re-arm churn is its own wedge
trigger), `needsIcmRelight`, and `rediscoverDelayMs` read the digest-pure gate — a pending
image always has the BLE fallback carrying it, so it is never an outage to "heal". This whole predicate
family is now a **pure `NanSyncPolicy`** (per-candidate `PeerFacts` snapshots carry `digestWanted` and
`bulkWanted` as sibling flags so the split is structural and JVM-tested); the transport keeps thin wrappers
that build the snapshot and call the policy. The two-tier watchdog clock is `NanWatchdogPolicy` and the
cue/SSI codec is `NanCueCodec` — both pure and tested alongside `NanConnectPolicy`/`NanServePolicy`. Marks are gated on a
fresh sighting (`BULK_FRESH_MS` 45 s, not the 150 s linger), fail-cooled 120 s on a failed initiate, and
never bypass connect backoff / single-slot admission / SETTLE. The composite grace-waits ≤ 10 s for the
NDP **off the inbound dispatch coroutine** (`onRequest`→`sendFile` runs inline in the router's single
inbound collector — a suspension there stalls both radios) then falls back to the link holder;
`sendFile` now returns enqueue-acceptance so a link that died in the check→enqueue window falls back
instead of silently dropping the file, and `BlobExchange` keeps a per-(hash, peer) 45 s serve memo so
the re-ask storm around a slow transfer (60 s re-offer, post-link-up `onNeighborAdded`) can't ship a
second full copy (field-verified: the late-NDP re-ask after a BLE fallback is real, and the memo ate it).
Since ADR 2026-09.4tx5 (#79) the link itself answers the two questions the memo could not: a receiver
reads `MeshTransport.arrivingFiles()` (off `FramedLink.rxFile`) and does not ask for a blob whose header is
already in, and a holder reads `fileInFlightTo(peer, key)` (the link's pending-file count, from the enqueue
to the end of the stream) and refuses a re-ask for a copy still queued or streaming to that peer. Since ADR
2026-10.y9qh (#115) that read is a map of each arriving key to the bytes in and the `size` the sender's
`FILE_HEADER` declared, and the chat samples it (`MeshController.arrivals`, every 500 ms while anything
streams in, 2 s otherwise, only while an attachment it shows is awaited) to draw a progress ring; the size is
a label, never a bound. The receiver logs `rx <KIND>/<hash> <size|?>B ← <peer>` at the header and
`rx … <N>B in <ms>ms ← <peer>` at the end — the end line times the bytes on air, where the sender's `file …`
line times only its feed (a different verb, so a `file ATTACHMENT/<hash>` grep still counts serves).
Frames, digests, avatars, and (when no NAN link is already up) sub-128 KiB blobs keep the BLE-first
route byte-for-byte. Every routing decision logs `file route: <kind>/<key> <N>B → <peer> <choice+why>`
(tag `CompositeMeshTransport`) and every arm accept/reject logs `bulk arm <peer> …` (tag
`WifiAwareTransport`), so "why did this ride BLE" is one grep away; the `FramedLink`
`file ATTACHMENT/<hash> <N>B in <ms>ms` line gives the per-plane timing, and `filesNan`/`filesBt`/
`bulkTimeouts` ride `…debug.STATE`. `bulkTimeouts` climbing much faster than `filesNan` means ghosts are
being armed.

## The BLE scan is demand-gated, and a *settled* clique used to scan continuously

`BluetoothMeshTransport.scanLoop` duty-cycles the scan, but `onScanResult` pokes the loop's wake channel
on **every** sighting — *including already-linked peers* — and the loop consumes a buffered wake
immediately, so whenever any peer is in range the idle gap collapsed to ~0 and the node scanned
back-to-back **forever** (the `PowerPolicy` idle intervals only ever bit when *nothing* was nearby). The
adaptive throttle (`ScanDemandPolicy`) fixes this by driving Boost/Floor from an explicit **demand**
check and splitting a dedicated `scanWake` channel (only `scanLoop` drains it; `connectLoop` keeps
`healSignal`) that `onScanResult` pokes **only for a genuine boost trigger** (a peer we'd initiate to,
above the RSSI floor, unlinked, off backoff). Floor (`settledIdleAfterScan`, ~2 min) engages only with
≥1 link and no candidate/chase — or while A2DP audio contends the radio. An isolated node never floors; it
hunts at `PowerPolicy.idleAfterScan`'s 12 s gap for three minutes from its last link's end (`noLinkSince`), then — on battery — relaxes: screen on
to a 60 s gap between its 12 s BALANCED windows (ADR 2026-09.w3xk, ≈ 4 % receiver duty from 12.5 %), screen
off to the duty cycle (120 s / 300 s); charging never. Every wake below (heal, a power edge, the adapter
coming on, a NAN sighting) ends the gap early with an immediate scan. Oracle: `bt scan lonely: relaxed
idle=…ms (alone …ms)` / `aggressive again`, and `alone=` on the 60 s `bt state` line. NAN acts as an **early-warning**: `CompositeMeshTransport.onForeignReachable` (the reverse of
`suppressDataPath`) tells BLE which peers another plane can see, and BLE boosts to chase them onto a link,
bounded by `PROMOTE_CHASE_MS` so a NAN-only / out-of-range peer can't pin Boost. Advertising is untouched
(always-on) so BLE-only devices still discover us — and *re-asserted*: the stack's own re-enable of the presence
set around a connection can be refused by the controller (0x0d beside a 15 ms link), silently when the connection
was ours, so `advertLoop` enables the live set again 2.5 s after every ACL edge, on a doubling wait after a reported
refusal, and on a 10 s (no link) / 60 s net (`AdvertReassertPolicy`, ADR 2026-10.9utz). Oracle: `bt advert refused
<status>, retry in <ms>` / `bt advert enabled again (refused for <ms>ms)`, `advert=` on the `bt state` line. **Load-bearing invariant: `reachable ⊇ neighbors`.**
BLE `reachable` is fed only from scan presence (90 s linger), so once the floor stops re-sighting a
linked peer it would vanish from the "nearby" UI while still linked — `publishReachable` unions live
links back in (`_reachable` only, never `_neighbors`, which routes sends). Verify on-device via the
`bt scan → floor/boost` logcat lines and that a linked peer stays in `…debug.STATE` reachable while the
scan is floored. The side channel below runs a **second** scan with its own policy (`SideScanPolicy`):
continuous at LOW_POWER/BALANCED while a flagged peer is around, Off during a connect, and rationed to
one start per 30 s because Android's five-starts-per-30 s budget is per app and this scan shares it.

## The BLE responder admits a dialer it never sighted (ADR 2026-09.shzv)

The larger node id dials, and the responder used to close every dialer that sorted below it. An iPhone
advertises no service data, so before A3 this side never sighted it and never dialed it; refusing its dial from
below left the pair unlinked for good. A3 (below) sights a foreground iPhone through its GATT payload, which puts
it under the old rule; A1 stays whole for the rest — a backgrounded iPhone, a dark reader, an iPhone build that
ignores the flag (the shzv amendment). A sighted iPhone's redial over a held link is refused like an Android
peer's, until the held link fails. `BleAdmissionPolicy.decide` keeps the old rule, unchanged, for a dialer presence
holds (below us: refused, our own dial wins; already linked: refused, which is also what stops a claimed id
cutting a sighted peer's link). It admits an unsighted dialer in either order, and its second link replaces the
first once the held one is 30 s old (`REPLACE_MIN_HOLD_MS`). Each link has its own `LinkEvents`, and
`teardownLink(…, only = link)` releases the slot only while that link holds it — the link's own end and an
eviction both pass the link they mean; the replaced link's `onLinkDown` used to remove its replacement. A link
the scan has not once sighted (`neverSighted`) scores the promotion floor (−90 dBm); a sighted peer that left
presence still scores −127. Oracle: `bt accepted client <id> (<verdict>, sighted=<bool>)` and `bt refused client
<id> (…)` at debug. Tests: `BleAdmissionPolicyTest`; the lab has no radio layer.

## A lonely node dials a larger peer it sights (ADR 2026-09.hj4a)

The tie-break left a smaller-id newcomer waiting on a settled, screen-off clique's floored scan — `120 s × (1 +
links)`, 360–600 s — and the clique's one post-link-down scan lands inside the newcomer's fresh backoff (#103). So a
node that has held **zero** links for `LONELY_AGGRESSIVE_WINDOW_MS` (180 s) may dial a sighted peer whose id sorts
**above** its own: `LonelyDialPolicy.pick`, PromotionPolicy's own gates (−90 dBm, 12 s dwell, off backoff) plus device
and PSM known, strongest first, one open at a time (an in-flight dial to a larger id can only be the lonely one). Its
clock is `noLinkSince` — transport start, restarted when the last link goes (`teardownLink`) — which the scan's
relaxed cadence reads too (w3xk's 2026-10-02 amendment; it used to run from the last link's start). The responder is unchanged: a
peer that has not sighted the newcomer admits it (shzv's unsighted admit), and one that has refuses it and dials it
by the tie-break; the refusal is an ordinary `HANDSHAKE` failure with the ordinary backoff, and a failure for a peer
whose own dial already linked bumps no streak. `LonelyDialPolicy.msUntilDue` wakes the connect loop when the window
closes or a candidate's dwell ripens, because on a screen-off phone every 8 s scan window restarts the dwell
(`presenceGapResetMs`), so the next sighting never ripens it. Scan untouched: zero links is always Boost. Oracle:
`bt lonely dial <id> (alone=<ms>ms rssi=<dBm> dwell=<ms>ms)` straight before that dial's `bt initiating to <id>` —
the iOS interop harness keys off the pair — and `alone=` on the `bt state` line. Tests: `LonelyDialPolicyTest`.

## Discovery keeps wall time, and its advert runs at full power (ADR 2026-10.pj9w, 2026-10.ryak)

The first Android-to-Android trial (2026-10-02) took 58–92 s to relink two Pixels four metres apart after a
Bluetooth toggle, and once not at all. Three causes, three rules:

- **A dial wakes when its dwell ripens.** A screen-off scan's gap is longer than `presenceGapResetMs` (8 s), so the
  next sighting restarts a candidate's 12 s dwell instead of ripening it. `PromotionPolicy.msUntilDue` (ordinary
  dial) and `LonelyDialPolicy.msUntilDue` (lonely dial) feed `nextConnectWaitMs`, so the connect loop runs between
  windows, when the dwell comes due. A new rule that gates a dial on the clock needs the same wake.
- **The waits a relink waits on run on `elapsedRealtime`** (`mesh/power/ElapsedWait`). A coroutine `delay` stops
  while the CPU is suspended: the Pixel 3's 60 s `bt state` line ran at a median 110 s, its 12 s dial watchdog at up
  to 26 s. The connect loop, the dial and HELLO watchdogs, the scan's pause behind a dial, the scan window and the
  **hunting** gap (`PowerPolicy.hunting`: no link, not yet relaxed) go through `elapsedWait`, which looks at the clock
  every 2 s of awake time; they never wake a sleeping phone, they stop losing the time it slept. The settled, linked
  and relaxed gaps keep stretching on purpose: they are power budgets measured on phones that stretched them. A new
  wait a relink waits on that uses `delay` or `withTimeoutOrNull` brings the stretch back, and only a suspending phone
  shows it. The `bt state` line itself keeps `delay` on purpose: its spacing is how far a phone sleeps.
- **The presence advert is `TX_POWER_HIGH`** (+1 dBm, the API's most). Every −90 floor reads it, while the link runs
  at the controller's power; at MEDIUM the pair four metres apart read −79..−90. The side pages and the Coded set go
  out at the same power (`BleAdvertiserTest.everyDiscoverySetAdvertisesAtFullPower`): a page must reach as far as
  the sighting that gated it, and the Coded credit's 12 dB holds only at equal power. A threshold on an advert
  reading is sized against HIGH.

Measure with `scripts/ble-link-trial.py` (`run` toggles one phone and times `bt link up` from both phones' logs on
the host clock; `summary` tabulates). Tests: `ElapsedWaitTest`, `PromotionPolicyTest`, `BleAdvertiserTest`.

## The BLE plane rings a peer's GATT doorbell when its HELLO asks (ADR 2026-09.dqvb)

iOS does not resume a suspended app for data on an open L2CAP channel, and does for a write to its own GATT
server, so an iPhone serves a **doorbell**, characteristic `f34c056b-5830-4243-a888-01f92f49e446` in a primary
`0xFE30` service (`DoorbellPolicy.SERVICE_UUID` / `DOORBELL_UUID`, pinned). It sets `Protocol.CAP_DOORBELL`
(`0x1000`) in its HELLO. Android never sets it, so no Android↔Android link touches GATT.

`registerLink` gives a link whose HELLO carries the bit a `BleDoorbell`, one coroutine per link that owns a
GATT client and a `DoorbellPolicy.Schedule`. `writeOnce` pokes it after enqueuing a frame (past the
`LinkCrossings` check). `typing`, `blobreq` and `keyreq` don't ring; digests, files and the HELLO never pass
through it.

- **The schedule is the port's own.** A ring at most every 5 s, plus one more after a burst.
- **The lookup runs at link-up, before any ring** (#102). `connectGatt(TRANSPORT_LE)` attaches to the link's own
  ACL; if it has not attached within 2 s the ACL is gone, and the timeout's close cancels the dial it turned into.
  Then `discoverServices`, then the characteristic, which must take a write without response.
- **Every lookup that finds the doorbell asks for `CONNECTION_PRIORITY_BALANCED`** (#102). An iPhone that dialed
  us is the central and runs the link at a 720 ms supervision timeout; the stack's discovery-time update lifts it
  to 5 s and then asks for 720 ms back. BALANCED carries AOSP's fixed 5 s timeout (30–50 ms, no latency), and iOS
  grants it. Asked after each lookup, so a re-lookup's discovery is followed by the request again.
- **The ask is repeated when the put-back wins** (`DoorbellPolicy.Balanced`). The stack re-sends the central's first
  values (720 ms from an iPhone, 420 ms from BlueZ) as discovery ends, and over the L2CAP-signalling path nothing
  orders that put-back against our ask. A timeout under 5 s reported by `onConnectionUpdated` after the ask asks
  again at once, and 2 s after the ask a settle check asks again unless a report since showed 5 s — the net for a
  framework that stops calling the hidden callback. At most two repeats per lookup, all for the same values; a
  report with a non-success status (`0x2A`, a re-ask colliding with the ask in flight) spends none. Device-verified:
  40 of 40 links ended at 5 s, with the iPhone and BlueZ as central (the last ten on this rule).
- **A ring is a 1-byte write without response.** Never with a response: a suspended app would have to answer it.
- **The client lives and dies with the link** (`teardownLink`, and `registerLink`'s replace branch): an open client
  holds the ACL.
- **The poke goes at the enqueue, not after the socket write.** A suspended iPhone's credits run out and the
  writer blocks until the ring wakes it.
- **A dialed link rings too** (A3). The dialer registers the link with the HELLO reply's full-width caps, not the
  advert's low byte, so a dialed iPhone's `CAP_DOORBELL` shows; a dialed Android↔Android link's `Peer.capabilities`
  is full width now, as the accepted side's was.

Oracle: `bt doorbell found|absent|lookup failed|wedged <id>`, `bt doorbell priority <id> requested=<bool>`,
`bt doorbell priority <id> again (put-back <ms>ms|settle) requested=<bool>` and
`bt conn params <id> interval=… latency=… timeout=…` (the hidden `onConnectionUpdated`) at info, `bt ring <id>` at
debug, and
`doorbells=`/`rings=` on the `bt state` line. Tests: `DoorbellPolicyTest`, `ProtocolTest`; `BleDoorbell` is
device-verified only.

## An Android phone finds an iPhone through its GATT payload (A3, ADR 2026-09.kwq2)

A foreground iPhone advertises only the `0xFE30` UUID and serves its 24-byte advert payload (cue zeroed) from
characteristic `848eedcd-a2e3-4fb2-86f9-e2c80821a497` (`DoorbellPolicy.PAYLOAD_UUID`) in the doorbell's service
(knit-ios ADR 2026-09.xzpt). While `BuildConfig.BLE_GATT_PEERS` is on (debug; dark in release until the trial):

- **The presence scan matches the UUID too** (`BleScanner(matchesServiceUuid)`, a second OR'd filter).
- **`onScanResult` splits.** Service data → `sight`, as always. A UUID-only advert → the cached payload for its
  address, sighted at this advert's RSSI; else a read launched on the transport's scope, with no scan wake.
- **`GattPayloads` paces the reads**, line for line with iOS: one at a time, 12 s each, 30 s after a failure, 10
  min after a stranger (no service, no characteristic, a value under 23 B); `cancel()` on radio stop; at most 64
  addresses, LRU (an iPhone's address rotates).
- **A payload lives until one of three rules forgets its address** (the contract's payload lifetime): a dial to it
  fails before its channel opens (never on HANDSHAKE); a HELLO on a link to it, accepted or the reply to ours, names
  another node; or it goes 60 s of scanning unheard with no link up (`GattPayloads.scanned`, fed each scan window).
- **`BleGattPayloadReader` is a dial**: `connectGatt(TRANSPORT_LE)` → discover → read → parse, 12 s in all, under
  `BleConnectArbiter("gatt-read")`, client always closed, no `requestMtu` (the Read Blob fetches 24 B at MTU 23).
  Never an address a link holds, never while an L2CAP dial is in flight or the arbiter is held; a promotion waits
  while a read runs.
- **The dial rule is unchanged.** A read iPhone is sighted, so the larger id dials and a sighted lower dialer is
  refused. The dialed link takes the reply HELLO's caps, so the doorbell rings it.
- **`FLAG_DIALS_GATT_PEERS` (0x02)** in the advert's flags byte tells an iPhone whose id sorts lower to wait to be
  dialed. Set only while the reader runs (`readvertise`, the same gate); it went on after the device gate passed.

Limits: in the iPhone-below order the first link waits on this phone's (possibly floored) scan cadence; a read
during iOS's PSM-change service swap is a 10-minute stranger, kept line for line with iOS; a backgrounded iPhone
cannot be sighted, and one below a flagged phone waits for a dial that can't come (free until iOS gains background
discovery); an identity change at an address that never goes quiet, new node below a flagged phone and old above,
keeps the old sighting until the address rotates or goes quiet. Oracle: `bt gatt read <addr> → <id>` /
`failed (<phase>)` / `stranger (<phase>)` and `bt gatt forget <addr> (dial|hello <id>|quiet)` at info, `bt gatt reading <addr>` at debug, `gattPayloads=`/`gattReads=` on `bt state`. Tests:
`GattPayloadsTest`, `BleAdvertPayloadTest`, `DoorbellPolicyTest`; the reader is device-verified only.

A debug build can cap the link budget below `PromotionConfig.DEFAULT_MAX_LINKS` (6) from Diagnostics or
`…debug.BLECAP` (`SettingsStore.debugBleLinkCap`, read as null in release). Only while a cap is set does the
transport count in-flight dials against it and pass `atCap` to `BleAdmissionPolicy.decide`, which turns an
Admit (never a Replace) into a Refuse — release keeps the shipped table and the accept-then-shed overflow path.

## A frame crosses a BLE link once, and the loops sleep until something can change

Two paths used to hand the Bluetooth plane the same frame for the same L2CAP stream — the router's flood copy
(`MeshRouter` → `CompositeMeshTransport.send`, `wire.relayed()`) and the fast path's link copy
(`fastFanout`, the immediate one, unrelayed) — and a relayed frame's fast copy went straight back over the link
it arrived on, because `fastFanout` has no hop id. Different bytes (`hops`), same `sig`, and the far end's
`SeenSet` dropped the second every time: room chat, reactions, receipts and profiles each crossed every link
twice. `mesh/link/LinkCrossings` is the per-link memo that stops it, keyed on `mesh/link/FrameKey` (the
sig-prefix key the side channel already used), marked on the way **in** as well as out, with the router
`SeenSet`'s ten-minute window and forgotten with the link — so what it skips is exactly what the receiver
would have dropped, and a peer that restarted with an empty `SeenSet` gets a clean stream. `BleFastRoutePolicy`
additionally never routes a frame to its own author (a page-first hearing re-fans with the author as hop,
which the router's split horizon can't exclude). Counter: `bleLinkDupSkipped`, about one per room frame per
link. The lab's `LabTransport` keeps the same memo (`dupSkipped`), so the box stays the plane as shipped
(`SideChannelLabTest.aFrameCrossesEachPipeOnce`). ADR 2026-09.6nmy.

The loops around the radio no longer poll on a fixed short tick: `scanLoop`'s paused branch waits 60 s while
the adapter is off (the `STATE_ON` receiver wakes it) and the longest connect watchdog + 3 s while a connect is in
flight (its end wakes it), `connectLoop` sleeps until the earliest connect backoff expires or the lonely dial
comes due (hj4a), clamped to 1–60 s (`ConnectBackoffPolicy.nextDueWaitMs`), instead of every 5 s, `advertLoop`
sleeps until the presence set's next re-assert (9utz) — 60 s while the adapter is off, and both
transports' diagnostic state line runs every 60 s and builds its string only in debug builds. Every wait is still a timeout, so a lost wake costs latency,
never liveness.

## The BLE side channel is a page carousel, not a message queue (ADR 2026-09.sjaa)

`mesh/bluetooth/BleSideChannel` is the BLE analogue of the NAN coordination plane's fast fan-out
(knit/knit-next#13): the `shouldFastFanout` frames — room chat, reactions, receipts, group meta, profiles,
plus the room typing cue — ride **non-connectable extended-advertising pages** under
`BleConstants.SIDE_SERVICE_UUID` (`0xFE38`), connectionless and scheduled by the controller apart from the
ACL, so they bypass a blob head-of-line-blocking the L2CAP stream and reach a sighted-but-unlinked peer.
It lives *inside* `BluetoothMeshTransport` (which now declares `hasFastPlane`; `fastFanout` keeps the link
copy the composite used to send and adds the page, `fastSend` is the link only — nothing DM-form rides a
broadcast carrier), gated by `BuildConfig.BLE_SIDE_PLANE` (debug on, release off) through one seam: the
`BleSideChannel?` DI hands the transport. A page is **one** `FastFrameCodec` unit (`0x03`/`0x05`, or one
`0x04` fragment) ≤ `PAGE_BYTES` = 236 B — one AUX PDU, because an AD structure caps at 252 B, an in-place
update on a live set must be one HCI operation, and a chained page is lost whole. `SideCarousel` (pure)
rotates the queue through `SLOTS` = 2 sets: a 12 s dwell from first air (one screen-off scan interval),
a 30 s linger when nothing waits, fewer-part frames first, a started frame finishes first, typing
coalesced per sender, 30 s freshness, capacity 32. The gate is a BLE-local **flags byte** the presence
advert grew (`BleAdvertPayload` 23 → 24 B, the last byte of the 31-byte budget; `FLAG_SIDE_CHANNEL` set
only while the controller passed its extended-advertising probe), tracked by `SideCapableTracker` with a
10-min linger *or* a live link (restamped at the link's end), since presence prunes at 90 s. The receive
scan is the channel's battery cost, so `SideScanPolicy` runs it only while a page could say something the
links will not — a flagged peer is sighted but **unlinked**, or a file is streaming on one of our links — and
is Off for an all-linked clique with nothing streaming (ADR 2026-09.u8qj; `SideCapableTracker.audience`
tells the two apart, and the sender's page offer still keys on `anyCapable`). A page carries no hop id and is never
presence (each set has its own RPA; `fromNodeId` is the author, ADR 038's rule); fragments reassemble by
fragment id, seeded at random per process. Grep `ble-side` (bring-up probe, `offer`, `heard`, `rx →`);
counters `bleSide*` on `…debug.STATE`. In the JVM, `mesh/lab/LabPages` is the pages' air and
`SideChannelLabTest` runs the author-as-hop, linkless-listener and never-DM shapes through the real
`BleFastRoutePolicy` and codec against the full oracle (`context/testing.md`). Device trial owed before the
release flag flips — the ADR lists it.

## Links step down to the Coded PHY at range — an experiment (ADR 2026-10.yvn6)

Dark in release behind `BuildConfig.BLE_CODED_PHY`; in debug the mode (`SettingsStore.debugBlePhyMode`: off, auto,
coded, 1m) is set from Diagnostics or `…debug.PHY` and applied without a restart. With it on, and on a controller
that reports `isLeCodedPhySupported`:

- **A second presence set on Coded** (`BleAdvertiser.codedParams()`, extended + connectable, HIGH power) carries
  the same payload bytes as the legacy advert. The presence scan goes extended on every PHY (`BleScanner.phys`
  = `ScanPhys.ALL`). While the phone has no link, or an unlinked peer is heard on Coded alone, every other
  window is Coded-only (`CodedPhyPolicy.scanPhys`, never two in a row). The legacy advert stays: legacy-only
  scanners and the 31-byte budget need it.
- **One RSSI per PHY.** `BlePresenceTracker` reports the stronger on the 1M scale (Coded + 12 dB,
  `CodedPhyPolicy.effectiveRssi`; the credit is `PhyTuning.codedCreditDb`), so every −90 floor reads what it always
  did with the experiment off. A Coded hit after a Coded hit is continuous presence across 30 s
  (`codedGapResetMs`), not the 1M path's 8 s.
- **The dial picks the PHY.** A peer heard on Coded alone (`codedOnly`: Coded kept hearing it for more than 8 s of
  *1M listening* after its last 1M hit, `Snapshot.codedLagMs`) is dialed at its Coded address. The clock runs only
  while a window listens on 1M (`BlePresenceTracker.onOneMListening`), because a Coded-only window cannot hear a 1M
  advert; on the wall clock it made every close peer Coded-only (the ADR's 2026-10-02 (3) amendment). The peer's mark
  outlives its presence entry (64, least recently used out). A plain L2CAP connect to that address lands on Coded
  (spike-verified). That dial's watchdog is 25 s, not 12 (`CodedPhyPolicy.connectTimeoutMs`): Android's initiator
  listens on Coded 15 ms in every 60 while it connects, and the stack's own direct-connect timeout is 30 s. The
  tie-break and every dial rule are untouched.
- **A drop at range makes the dialed side's Coded advert fast.** When a link with a PHY handle ends on its own
  (`eof`) on Coded or at the step-down edge, the smaller id — the side the other dials back — advertises Coded every
  250 ms for 3 min (`CodedAdvertPace`, `PhyTuning.fastAdvertMs` / `fastHoldMs`), until that peer links again. The
  interval moves in place (`BleAdvertiser.setInterval`: disable, `setAdvertisingParameters`, enable; same set, same
  address), 2.5 s after the drop so it stays out of the stack's pause and resume around the disconnection (9utz). Two
  refused fast enables give the window up. The Coded set rides the presence set's re-assert turns (9utz) and has
  retries of its own (`codedKeeper`): a refused enable, and up to five restarts of a start the stack failed
  internally (status 4); TOO_MANY_ADVERTISERS and FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED stay dark until the next bring-up.
- **Admission.** While the experiment runs, a dialer heard on Coded alone counts as unsighted
  (`CodedPhyPolicy.sightedForAdmission`) and is admitted whatever the id order. Otherwise a far pair waits on
  each other: the responder refuses, and its own dial never clears the dwell (the first walk, the ADR's
  amendment). A dialer heard on 1M keeps shzv's tie-break.
- **`BlePhyControl` per capable link** — a GATT client on the link's ACL, the `BleDoorbell` pattern — reads link
  RSSI and asks `PhyStepper` (pure, JVM-tested) to step down to Coded S=8 and back up to 1M or 2M — the step-up
  passes both masks and the controller picks, so a link that visited Coded is never pinned to 1M; only the `1m`
  mode asks for 1M alone. The larger id drives. A request unanswered in
  3 s, or answered with another PHY, gives up for the link (a controller without Coded answers nothing at all).
  Mode OFF lets the handles go and leaves each link on its PHY: asking a far Coded link back to 1M drops it.
- **A file is paced by the link's PHY** (#114). `FramedLink` reads its `PaceConfig` before every chunk:
  `CodedPhyPolicy.pace` gives a link last read on Coded 1 KiB/s in 2 KiB chunks (`PhyTuning.codedPaceBytesPerSec` /
  `codedChunkBytes`), any other 28 KiB/s in 16 KiB, and a change restarts the pace's clock (`PaceWindow`). The PHY a
  link was last read on outlives its handle (`linkPhy`), since OFF leaves the link where it is. At 28 KiB/s a whole
  photo reached a Coded link's stack in seconds and every frame after it waited minutes. No wire change.
- **Diagnostics** draws a PHY chip on each directly-connected row with a handle (`CodedPhyDiag.linkPhys`, testTag
  `ble_phy_chip_<nodeId>`).

Oracles: `bt phy mode=…`, `bt coded advert live|dark <status>`, `via=coded|1m` on `bt initiating to`,
`bt phy <id> link dropped on <PHY> rssi=… (<reason>)`, `bt coded advert fast (…)` / `slow`, `bt coded advert
refused <status>, retry in …` / `enabled again`, `bt coded advert retry n/5`,
`bt phy <id> ONE_M→CODED rssi=… (auto)`, `bt phy <id> gave up …`, `file …/… <N>B in <ms>ms @<pace>`, `bt scan coded windows on|off`,
`bt refused client … codedOnly=`, and once a minute `bt coded heard <id> hits=… rssi=a..b 1m=… eff=… dwell=…
promotable=… dials=…` per unlinked peer heard on Coded (raise the log ring with `adb logcat -G 16M` before a walk);
counters `bleCoded*` / `blePhy*`; the `…debug.PHY` reply lists each link's PHY and link RSSI and each peer's
per-PHY ages and RSSIs. Link RSSI reads ~20 dB
stronger than the adverts at the same spot, so step thresholds and advert floors are on different scales.
