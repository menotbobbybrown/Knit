# LoRa bridge (Meshtastic over BLE) — the long-range Nearby-room + DM plane

How Knit carries **broadcast (Nearby-room) frames and sealed 1:1 DMs** over LoRa via a Meshtastic board
attached over BLE. The design rationale is ADR 038 (the plane) and ADR 039 (DMs); this file is the
operational detail. Behind `BuildConfig.LORA_PLANE`, which is **on everywhere since 2.5.0** (ADR
2026-09.6gtm; `-PloraPlane=false` rebuilds the dark artifact 2.3.0–2.4.x shipped). Visible is not enabled:
`SettingsStore.loraEnabled` still defaults false and nothing leaves over the radio until a board is paired
and set up.

## Shape

**Nothing here ticks until a board is configured** (ADR 2026-09.5bqu). The child is in the composite on
`BuildConfig.LORA_PLANE` alone, so on most installs it is started and never armed; `gossipLoop` and
`lingerSweepLoop` therefore park on `awaitConfigured()` rather than running the ADR 044 election over an
empty heard set once a minute forever. Losing the board runs the same `quiesce()` that `stop()` does —
that is what makes the parking safe, since `recomputeReachable` is the only thing that ages `lastHeardAt`
out, and a parked sweep would otherwise strand the last board's peers in `reachable` permanently.

`LoraMeshTransport` (`mesh/lora/`, pure) is a **fast-plane-only** `CompositeMeshTransport` child, added
LAST (lowest send-preference). `neighbors` is always empty, so the flood / custody digest sync / keyreq /
blob pulls never touch the ~1 kbps link — `send`/`sendFile`/`sendDigest` are no-ops. Only
`fastFanout`/`longRangeFanout`/`fastSend` ride it, gated by `LoraFramePolicy`:

- **FANOUT** (`fastFanout` — the composite's coordination-plane blast — and `longRangeFanout` — the seam
  reserved for a plane with no data path, ADR 039; both land in one internal `fanout`): broadcast `chat` +
  broadcast `reaction` (recipientId == null && group == null), `profile`, and **DM-form chat** (`chat &&
  recipientId != null && group == null`, any `relay`). The DM form is admitted opaque: a DM, its sealed
  receipt/reaction, a session reset, a group-key seed and an escalated group tick are wire-indistinguishable
  and all ride. `shouldLongRangeFanout` (`mesh/FrameFanout.kt`) is what feeds it, from `originateSigned` and
  `onDeliver` — never widen `shouldFastFanout` for this; that predicate is the NAN coordination plane's.
  **The recipient gate (ADR 054):** a DM-form frame addressed to us, or to a peer BLE/NAN holds a **live link**
  to (`coveredByLink`, read off `linkedPeers` — links, never sightings), is skipped on this path and on the
  bridge backfill before the sig-dedup slot is spent: the link carries it. Counted `loraSkippedLinked`. **The
  second cover (ADR 2026-09.y5f3):** a DM-form frame to a peer a connected spool heard from within
  `SPOOL_COVER_MS` (15 min) is skipped the same way — fan-out, backfill, targeted send and the first-hearing
  re-offer alike, and a frame already queued is abandoned at dequeue (`StaleAtSend.INTERNET`) — because the
  frame is in the spool anyway and the spool costs no air; the field day spent a window on DM copies the
  spool had already delivered. Fed by `MeshTransport.coveredByInternet` (`internetPeers`, from
  `MeshManager`'s spool-presence watch), counted `loraSkippedInternet`, shown as `internetCovered` in
  `…debug.LORA`. A cover, never an election input: it does not touch `linkedPeers` or the role. The
  originator's `FanoutHint` (`CONTENT`/`TICK`) rides beside the frame — see Pacing.
- **TARGETED** (`fastSend`): `receipt`, and `chat && !wire.relay && recipientId == to` (AckSync's sealed
  `CTL_RECEIPT` tick — a flooded DM never rides this path, so no `fastSend` caller can widen it). Since ADR
  2026-09.y5f3 this is how a **room post's** ✓✓ reaches an author only the board can hear: the tick waits
  `AckSync.RIDE_HOLD_MS` (60 s) for a frame already going that way, then — if no spool covers the author —
  is sealed once and fast-sent here, one packet, class `TICK`, retried on the owed backoff. Between ADR aa27
  (2026-09-05) and this it was never asked: "absent" meant no BLE/NAN link, and a LoRa-only author was absent
  (zero `lora tx send:` on two phones over a whole field day). The Internet cover above is the one gate this
  path has; ADR 044's "never gate `fastSend`" was about the role, and a cover is not a role.

Everything else (group-form chat, `groupupdate`/`groupleave`, `typing`, `blobreq`/`keyreq`) is refused.

Outbound decodes `wire.signed` only to apply the policy, then reuses `FastFrameCodec` (ADR 030) to
compact/fragment: `sig`/`signed` pass through byte-exact, so this is **not a wire change** and the
originator's signature verifies unchanged. One packet may leave *larger* than the frame needs
(ADR 2026-09.mhs5): a 2.8 board signs anything at or under 165 B, so `LoraFrameCodec` grows the frame's **last**
packet to 166 and the board sends it unsigned — a few bytes of pad instead of 66 of signature, ~20 % off the
tick and the room post. Two rules keep that safe. The pad is only legal where a receiver ignores trailing
bytes, which is a **deflated** body (`FastFrameCodec.deflated`; a stored `0x03` would swallow the pad into
`signed` and corrupt silently, a stored `0x05` rejects it) — and the frames with most to gain *store*, because
the ADR 060 transcoder already took the compressible keys out, so a stored one-packet frame is re-deflated
first (`FastFrameCodec.deflatedForm`, a measured +5 B) whenever `LoraAirtime` prices the result cheaper.
Only the last packet moves, so the fragment count cannot change; fragmented stored frames are the case this
does not reach. Verified on a 2.8 board (2026-09-01): a real room post logs `lora pad fanout:chat +46B past
the signature cliff`, and a 166-byte payload is heard on a second board as `Lora RX … encrypted len=190` /
`Packet RX: 1262ms` where 165 B reads `len=255` / `1655ms` — that `encrypted len` is the cleanest signing
oracle there is, since `len = payload + 24` unsigned and +66 signed. **The tolerance is an accident of `inflate`'s loop, not a designed property** —
`FastFrameCodecTest.aDeflatedFrameIgnoresTrailingBytesBecauseThePaddedLoraSenderDependsOnIt` is what stops a
future "hardening" from breaking every padded sender against older receivers. Meshtastic `Data.payload` cap = **231 B** on the air for a Knit
packet (`MeshtasticProto.MAX_PAYLOAD`: the firmware transmits at most a 237-byte `Data`, and the two-byte
`PRIVATE_APP` portnum plus the payload framing take 6 — the proto's `DATA_PAYLOAD_LEN = 233` assumes a one-byte
portnum; measured 2026-08-29: 231 queues, 232 NAKs `TOO_LARGE`) → ≤ 3 fragments (ceiling `3 × 227 = 681 B`
compact); an MTU-255 board takes 228. Every frame the transcoder reproduces leaves in the `0x05` transcoded
form (`mesh/link/FrameTranscoder`, ADR 060; `loraTranscoded`, `transcodeFallbacks`) — a **flag-day** while the
plane is debug-only, since a LoRa sighting carries no capability: an older debug build on the channel drops
`0x05` as `UNKNOWN_TAG`. The gate it needs before the plane ships to release is in the roadmap. Before the board reports its MTU the cap is the MTU-255 floor
(`LoraMeshTransport.PRE_READY_PAYLOAD`), not the maximum — frames fanned out during the connect used to be
chunked at 233 and every one came back `TOO_LARGE`. Inbound mirrors `WifiAwareTransport.emitFastWire`: decode/reassemble →
`_inbound.tryEmit(InboundFrame(wire, env, fromNodeId = env.senderId))`, so the router's dedup / verify /
custody / relay all run unchanged.

> **`reachable` here is *reach*, never *nearby*, and only fresh frames feed it** (ADR 2026-09.2ajk).
> The set is keyed on the frame **author**, and a gateway puts other people's frames on air, so a peer

`MeshtasticProto` + `ProtoIo` are a hand-rolled protobuf codec (zero new deps): `ToRadio{want_config_id,
heartbeat, disconnect, packet{Data{portnum=PRIVATE_APP 256, payload}}}` out; `FromRadio{my_info,
config_complete_id, packet, queueStatus, rebooted, channel, metadata}` in; `Routing.error_reason` NAKs.
Golden byte vectors pin every field number; malformed input decodes to null, never throws.

## Board facts (verified 2026-08-24)

- Service `6ba1b218-15a8-461f-9fa8-5dcae273eafd`; ToRadio `f75c76d2-…` (write), FromRadio `2c55e69e-…`
  (read; one protobuf per read, 0 bytes = drained), FromNum `ed9da18c-…` (notify, u32 LE counter).
- Bonding required in PIN modes; the V4's OLED shows a random 6-digit PIN. MTU 512 requested (gate ≥ 263 so
  the worst-case 259-B `ToRadio{packet}` is one write). ESP32 = **one BLE client** — the Meshtastic app must
  be disconnected from the board. Board **Wi-Fi must be off** (it disables the board's Bluetooth).
- **The Exchange MTU must not race the bonding handshake** (verified 2026-09-01, Heltec V4 / 2.8 alpha
  `2.8.0.7239fe8`). A bonded board starts SMP the moment the ACL is up, and `connectGatt`'s
  `STATE_CONNECTED` reaches us *before* the link is encrypted — so an MTU request sent on that callback
  lands mid-handshake and the board answers too late to be heard: the app sees the default 23 with a
  non-success status (`onConfigureMTU(…, 23, 6)`), and the real response shows up in the stack log as
  `ATT - Ignore wrong response. Receives (03)`. `MeshtasticGatt` therefore waits `SETTLE_MS` before the
  first exchange and retries, and `onMtuChanged` trusts the reported size over the status (the stack
  reports the bearer's current MTU either way). This is not board-specific and not Knit-specific — the
  Meshtastic app loses the same race; BlueZ wins it only because it touches no ATT until the link is
  encrypted, which is the fastest way to tell a phone-side stall from a real board fault.
- Handshake: write `ToRadio{want_config_id=N}`, drain FromRadio until `config_complete_id=N` (no MeshPacket
  before that); then FromNum notify → drain until empty. `ToRadio{heartbeat}` every 180 s keeps the phone
  API alive; the node answers `queueStatus{free,maxlen,mesh_packet_id}` (also after each packet) — flow
  control. `rebooted`/unsolicited `my_info` → re-handshake.
- Send `MeshPacket{to=0xFFFFFFFF, channel=idx, id=client nonzero, hop_limit=3
  (`LoraMeshTransport.HOP_LIMIT`, **stated**), want_ack=false}`.
  **Omitting it does not mean the node's default — it means zero** (measured 2026-09-04, fw
  `2.8.0.47db0e3`, `lora.hop_limit = 3`). A/B from one board to another, 6 x 200 B each arm, watching the
  receiving board's own `airUtilTx` over serial: with the field omitted every packet arrived
  `hop_limit = 0 / hop_start = 0` and the neighbour relayed **nothing** (0.7348611 % flat across the arm);
  with `--ei hop 3` every packet arrived `3/3` and the neighbour's airtime rose **+0.2646 % = 9.5 s**, about
  five of the six repeated. The same board's NodeDB shows 110/110 stock nodes sending `hop_start = 3`. So
  2.8's `LOCAL_ONLY` **does** relay a secondary-channel packet, and the only thing stopping ours is a hop
  limit of zero: until this was stated, ADR 045's borrowed hops had never happened and ADR 044's bridge had
  only ever worked board-to-board **direct**. `everyPacketLeavesWithHopsToSpend` is what stops it
  regressing — a missing hop limit is invisible in the payload, so only the send records catch it. Reading
  the board's own `lora.hop_limit` instead is deliberately not done: absent decodes as 0, which is the bug.

  **The airtime this buys is not yet budgeted.** Measured, 8 x 200 B from one board with the other in range
  and originating nothing:

  | | originator | neighbour |
  |---|---|---|
  | hop omitted | +0.365 % (13.1 s) | **-0.042 %** — decay, nothing relayed |
  | `hop = 3`   | +0.389 % (14.0 s) | **+0.443 % (15.9 s)** — pure relay |

  The originator's own cost is the same in both arms, so the whole difference is the neighbour: **one
  relaying board doubles a packet's air**, and `LoraAirtime`'s ledger did not move by a millisecond in
  either arm. In a 100 %-duty region the only ceiling is the 10 % politeness figure, halved by `SAFETY` to
  the 5 % it budgets — so **the safety factor is worth exactly one relaying neighbour**, before any stock
  node repeats us. Owed a follow-up.
- NAKs: portnum ROUTING_APP(5), `request_id` = our id, `error_reason` (NO_CHANNEL 6,
  TOO_LARGE 7, DUTY_CYCLE_LIMIT 9, RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED 38) — counted per reason as `loraNakByReason`.
- The router transmits at most a **237-byte `Data`** (`MeshtasticProto.LORA_DATA_MAX`, measured 2026-08-29 on a
  Heltec V4 / 2.7.26 with `…debug.LORATX`: a 231-byte payload queues, 232 and 233 NAK `TOO_LARGE`). The
  firmware's own budget is 239 (`MAX_LORA_PAYLOAD_LEN` 255 − the 16-byte header, `MeshtasticProto.DATA_ENCODED_MAX`);
  the two-byte gap the lab measured is `Data.bitfield`, which `Router::perhapsEncode` fills in after us. The ATT
  MTU is the *other* limit (`mtu − 27` at MTU 255 = 228); the effective cap is the smaller of the two.
- **Firmware 2.8 signs the broadcasts it sends for us.** `Router::perhapsEncode` attaches a 64-byte XEdDSA
  signature (`Data.xeddsa_signature`, +66 B with framing) to any non-PKI broadcast it originates that still
  fits signed — so a Knit payload **≤ 165 B** (`MeshtasticProto.MAX_SIGNED_PAYLOAD`) grows by 66 B on the air
  and a larger one goes unsigned exactly as before. It is a cliff, not a ramp, and it falls between ADR 060's
  one-packet room tick (157 B, +36 % air) and its one-packet DM ✓✓ (221 B, unchanged). Knit cannot ask for it
  or decline it; `LoraAirtime` charges for it, and since ADR 2026-09.mhs5 **dodges** it — see the codec note
  below. Receiving is unaffected while
  `Config.SecurityConfig.packet_signature_policy` is at its `COMPATIBLE` default — under `STRICT` a board
  drops every unsigned packet, which after the padding is every Knit frame rather than most of them;
  `BALANCED` is safe (it drops only unsigned packets that *could* have been signed, and a padded frame could
  not). **The phone gets the whole story** (ADR 2026-09.ggq4, verified on both lab tags): the 64-byte
  `Data.xeddsa_signature` rides up intact, and the board's own verdict `MeshPacket.xeddsa_signed` (field 22,
  computed on receive against the key *its* NodeDB holds, never trusted off the air) beside it, plus
  `NodeInfo.has_xeddsa_signed` (14) and `DeviceMetadata.has_xeddsa` (14, which `LoraAirtime.onFirmware` now
  takes ahead of the version parse). The signing input is `LE32(from) ‖ LE32(id) ‖ LE32(portnum) ‖ payload`
  under the board's Curve25519 key converted to Ed25519 (`y = (u − 1)/(u + 1)`, sign bit 0); on 2.8 a node
  number **is** the CRC32 of that key. The text cliff is **166 B** (one-byte portnum), the Knit-frame one 165.
  Two rules to remember: a signed packet that fails against the key the *receiving* board holds is dropped
  before the phone sees it, whatever the policy — a stale or planted key silently blackholes that sender —
  and an unverifiable one (no key in the NodeDB) is passed up with the signature and the flag false.

## Key bootstrap (the far side has never seen the author's profile)

Two paths: (1) `MeshManager.watchReachable` already refloods our profile on a new `reachable` peer;
(2) `LoraMeshTransport` beacons its own signed profile (`ProfileFrameSource` ← `MeshManager`) on
session-up under a **5-min floor** and on first hearing a peer under a **60-s gap** (one timestamp, two
gaps — ADR 039 §8: a peer that just appeared has demonstrably never heard us, and without a periodic beacon
this is the only way a late arrival learns our key). The composite's self-profile `fastFanout` shares the
5-min floor. `PendingInbound` (~2 min) replays the parked chat once the profile pins the key. A **sig-keyed
SeenSet** (first 8 B of `sig`, 10 min) recorded on send *and* receive stops re-fanning a LoRa-received
frame and bounds AckSync's 24 h verbatim tick retries. A cleartext `receipt` is rebuilt with a fresh id per attempt, so
`fastSend` keys it on (recipient, acked id) instead (`targetedKey`, ADR 2026-09.6gk8), and AckSync backs off
both forms on the same doubling schedule.

## Bridging pockets (ADR 044)

Two BLE/NAN cliques ("pockets") out of range of each other, one board-holder in each, boards in LoRa range.
**Live traffic already crossed** before ADR 044 and still does with no new machinery: `InboundPipeline.onDeliver`
re-fans every first-seen *relayed* frame, and `fanout` never checked authorship — so a post by any pocket-A
member reaches A's gateway over BLE, crosses the hop, and floods pocket B from B's gateway. ADR 044 adds the
three things that were missing.

**A gateway role.** `LoraGatewayPolicy`: anything publishing a `LoraCtl` OFFER has a board; a publisher we
hold a **live link** to (`suppressDataPath`, the higher-preference planes' `neighbors`) is a co-pocket rival,
one we do not is the bridge peer and is never suppressed. Lowest publisher key wins; the rest go PASSIVE and
suppress the **floodable** paths (fan-out, beacon, offer, backfill) — inbound is untouched, so a spare board
still feeds its pocket, and `fastSend` is untouched too (a `relay = false` targeted tick is owed by one node,
never flooded, so no co-pocket board has a copy to relay *or* to duplicate). Recovery: on a lost link, on a
gateway ageing past `STALE_MS` (45 min), and on the 60-s sweep — being wrongly passive is total silence, so it
must never need an event to recover. Closes ADR 038's "one board per clique" residual.

> **It must be the link set, never `reachable`.** BLE publishes presence adverts far beyond L2CAP range and
> Wi-Fi Aware keeps a peer reachable for 150 s after its last cue, so a sighting is not a data path — and
> standing down is only safe toward a board our frames can actually be handed to. Electing on `reachable`

> those receipts stranded. `…debug.LORA` reports `role` with both its inputs plus `pocketSightings`, so the
> gap between heard and linked is visible rather than inferred.

**The bridge covers the targeted tick's last hop too** (ADR 2026-09.wkbk). A far pocket's room ✓✓ leaves its
acker as the targeted `send:chat` — a `relay = false` frame addressed to one phone — and the near gateway
hears it off the air like any other. If that phone is board-less and sits one link behind the gateway,
nothing used to carry it the rest of the way: the router does not flood a `relay = false` frame,
`InboundPipeline.onDeliver` drops one that is not ours, and a room tick never escalates into custody (ADR
2026-09.aa27). `MeshRouter.handOn` now sends it over that link, once — DM-form chat only, split horizon,
hop-capped, and keyed on `neighbors` rather than `reachable` for the reason the note above gives. It is not
LoRa-specific machinery, but this plane is where it fires: the broadcast air is the only way a
`relay = false` frame reaches a node that is not its addressee. **Dave's half is still open** — an acker
with no board and no spool has nowhere to send a tick at all.

**An airtime governor.** `LoraAirtime` (pure): time-on-air from the LoRa formula at the board's own preset
(231 B at LongFast ≈ 2 s) **plus the signature 2.8 adds to anything under the cliff** — gated on the board's
firmware (`LoraAirtime.signsPackets`, from the handshake's `DeviceMetadata`; unknown reads as signing, since
under-charging can cost compliance where over-charging only costs throughput) **less whatever `padTo` dodges**
(ADR 2026-09.mhs5 — the same governor that prices the cliff is the one the codec asks whether to pad past it), a rolling **15-minute window** (ADR 054 — it was an hour, and a burst of chat then
blacked the plane out for the rest of it; the hourly total is unchanged, the worst straddling hour ≤ 6.25 %),
and one allowance = `min(region duty cycle, 10 % politeness) × 0.5` of the window — **45 s of air at LongFast**.
Those two ceilings are computed **independently** (ADR 067): the regional duty cycle is law and only the
firmware's own `override_duty_cycle` lifts it, while the 10 % is Knit's manners toward everyone else on the
shared band — which a dedicated RF slot makes vacuous. So a board on a dedicated slot in a 100 %-duty region
gets **450 s a window**, one in EU_868 still gets 45 s, and the unlock is a constructor flag wired to
`BuildConfig.DEBUG` (`LoraAirtime` itself stays pure and is tested both ways).
`AirBucket.LIVE` may spend all of it; `AirBucket.BRIDGE` (backfill + the ADR 039 re-offer) is capped
at 30 %, so backfill degrades before live chat does. The OFFER is **not** in that bucket: it books
`AirBucket.GOSSIP` and is judged only against the window *total* (ADR 2026-09.t8t8 for the exemption,
ADR 2026-09.7c8n for the bucket — booking an exempt class against the share it is exempt from put the whole
cost of gossip on the one class with nowhere to fall back to, and at the Trickle floor that is ~44 % of
serving's budget: field-observed 2026-09-07 at `bridgeMs 14026/13500` with `liveMs 0/45000`). An OFFER is not
backfill, it is the packet that decides whether any backfill happens at all — including the far pocket's,
whose air this budget does not pay for — so a gateway busy serving used to starve its own offers and thereby
silence the other pocket entirely (field-observed 2026-09-04: `BRIDGE 13372/13500`, two transmitted offers
against seven published, the far side hearing none and holding a room post ~30 min). What bounds gossip is the
Trickle timer, not a share; a reserved *slice* of BRIDGE was rejected because it cannot be sized across presets
(a 48-prefix OFFER is ~2 s at LongFast and ~13 s at LongSlow against the same 13.5 s budget). Only one OFFER is
ever queued — `publishOffer` calls `LoraPacePolicy.dropQueued`, since a superseded snapshot names a set we have
since changed. Serving also asks the budget **before** it queues (`serveOne` → `Serve.NO_AIR`, which **skips that
candidate** — ADR 2026-09.7c8n; it used to end the round, and since `backfillRank` puts the priciest
candidate first, a window holding a one-packet DM but not a three-packet room post served nothing at all),
so the hourly serve cap is no longer spent on frames that only class shedding will remove — and it asks
against what is already **queued** for BRIDGE (`LoraPacePolicy.pendingSizes`) as well as what is recorded, so
a round cannot promise more air than the window has left. Without that, a round passed admission whole and
then ran out of window part-way down the queue, and the frame the queue reached last was always the room post
the backfill rank had deliberately put *first* (`FrameClass` drains a DM before the room; `backfillRank`
spends slots the other way). ADR 2026-09.zkma;
`LoraBridgeTest.aRoundThatCannotPayForEverythingKeepsWhatTheRankChose`. `AirBucket.BOOTSTRAP` (a live `profile` fan-out, ours or
relayed — paired to `FrameClass.BOOTSTRAP` by `AirBucket.defaultFor`) is capped at 25 % and is the **one class
judged outside the total**, so the key bootstrap still rides a spent window (ADR 056). It used to be admitted
unconditionally *and* recorded, which is a budget with no floor: on the lab gateway 79 % of every LoRa frame
ever sent was a profile (see the re-fan gate below). A backfilled profile stays on `BRIDGE` — re-served
history, not bootstrap. `FrameClass.TICK` (our own delivery receipts, see Pacing) never spends the last 25 %
of a window. Region + preset
are read off the board (`FromRadio.config` → `Config.LoRaConfig`, pinned by `MeshtasticProtoTest`; conservative
5 % until reported). `LoraPacePolicy.take` consults it, skipping a refused frame rather than blocking behind
it, and **dequeue is now by class then FIFO** (a reversal of ADR 039 §5 — bursts of backfill must not queue-jump
a live message).

**Digest-driven backfill.** `LoraCtl` (tag **`0x10`**, beside `FastFrameCodec`'s `0x03`/`0x04`; an older build
drops it as `UNKNOWN_TAG`, which is what makes this additive) carries an OFFER: publisher key + ≤ 48 4-byte id
prefixes (`StoreDigest.hash64` truncated), never fragmented, one packet. `LoraGossipPolicy` is Trickle —
5 → 15 min doubling, transmit in the interval's second half, snap to the floor on news, suppress only on **set
equality** (a superset has not said what we needed to say). "News" includes a *heard* OFFER announcing a set
that is not ours (ADR 2026-09.qsj6), which `onCtlPacket` follows with a `gossipWake` poke like the other two
reset sites — without it the loop sleeps on the old due time, wakes past the reset interval's end and doubles.
It snaps only a **backed-off** interval, so a divergence that cannot converge (serve cap spent, permanent
superset) settles at the floor cadence instead of two gateways resetting each other into the window. Since
ADR 2026-09.7c8n what that floor spends is `GOSSIP`, so an unconvergeable divergence no longer eats the
serving budget that would end it — which is the loop it used to close;
and a reset never moves an unspent transmit point *later* than the one its interval already picked.
On a far gateway's OFFER: `BridgeFrameSource`
(`MeshManager` over `ForwardStore.liveFrames`, already TTL- and quota-bounded, so no extra age gate) returns
what the prefixes don't name, ranked profile → room → DM newest-first (ADR 2026-09.rre4 — the reverse of the
pacing queue's `FrameClass` order, on purpose: the queue asks who transmits first, the rank asks which frames
are worth a scarce slot, and a room post is readable by the whole far pocket for typically one packet against
a DM's one addressee for two); ≤ 4 per offer, ≤ 12 per publisher per
hour, and hard-bounded by the BRIDGE budget.

> **The offer names the head of that same ranked list** (`LoraFramePolicy.bridgeOrder`, ADR 2026-09.zkma) —
> one packet holds ~48 prefixes against a 1000-row store, so the offer is a *window*, and a frame it cannot

> `LoraBridgeTest.aRoomPostCrossesAPocketWhoseOfferIsFullOfRecentChat` and
> `onlyAnAuthorsNewestProfileIsWorthASlot`. Frames are re-wrapped verbatim like any custody

"Bridge distant groups" switch) gates offering and serving together.

> **`serveOne` consults neither dedup set** (ADR 2026-09.y8pu, and ADR 057 for `profileSeen` before it). An

**Multi-hop is Meshtastic's job.** A frame injected at a far gateway can't be re-transmitted (sig dedup) and a
second board there is PASSIVE, so a third pocket is reached by the board's own 3-hop flood, not by a second
phone-level send.

**One fan-out per publish (ADR 057).** A relayed `profile` used to be gated only by `sigSeen`, whose 10-minute
TTL matches `MeshRouter`'s SeenSet — so a profile that kept arriving looked first-seen again on every lapse and
re-fanned forever (`isFresh` exempts profiles from the staleness check on purpose: a profile's `sentAt` is a
publish stamp, hours old by design). A second set, `profileSeen`, keyed on the **frame id** (stable per publish,
new on republish) with `PROFILE_REFAN_MS` = 12 h = `MeshManager.PROFILE_REPUBLISH_MS`, now holds it. Checked
before `sigSeen` and after `encodeOrNull` — a held profile must leave the signature slot free for the backfill,
and an unencodable frame must not consume a window it never rode. `serveOne` is deliberately **not** gated:
the digest-driven backfill is what repairs a genuinely lost profile now (this plane refuses `keyreq`, so a far
pocket cannot ask) — the reasoning ADR 2026-09.y8pu later extended to `sigSeen`. Our own `sendSelfProfile` beacon is not gated either — its 5-min floor and 60-s
first-hearing gap are event-driven, and "a new listener appeared" is exactly when re-sending is the point.
Counter: `loraProfileRefanSkipped`.

## Pacing

`LoraPacePolicy` (pure): 3 s min inter-packet gap, a 32-frame queue (ADR 054 — sized to hold a 15-minute
wait), NAK back-off (rate/duty → a 60 s cool-down), hold while `queueFree == 0`, and (ADR 044) a hold while the
frame's [AirBucket] budget is spent — a refused frame is skipped rather than blocking the queue behind it.
When full the queue **sheds by class** (`FrameClass`: BOOTSTRAP > GOSSIP > DM > ROOM > TICK): the oldest
**whole** frame (never a lone fragment) of the lowest class present goes, the newcomer included — a room post
alone at the bottom is `REFUSED` rather than evicting a DM, and nothing ever evicts the profile bootstrap
(queue order only — since ADR 056 the bootstrap is metered on the air, and a profile refused by its share
waits in the queue for the next window rather than being dropped).
`TICK` is a frame **we** originated as a delivery receipt, said so by `FanoutHint.TICK` on
`MeshTransport.longRangeFanout` (the transport cannot read a sealed frame); a relayed DM-form frame stays `DM`,
and every `fastSend` frame is a tick by policy. Dequeue runs the same class order forwards since ADR 044
(highest class first, FIFO within it — bursts of gossip/backfill must not queue-jump a live message). Both
eviction and refusal count as `loraDroppedQueue`.

**Freshness gate** (fan-out paths only, room included): a `chat`/`reaction` whose `sentAt` is more than
15 min old (`LoraFramePolicy.FRESH_MS`) is a custody re-serve and is not fanned — without it a newcomer's
whole backfill re-fanned over the air, twelve frames at a time. Profiles (publish-stamped `sentAt`) and
receipts are exempt, as are the targeted path (AckSync's verbatim retries) and the re-offer. It reads the
injected `wallClock` (epoch) — the transport's `clock` is `elapsedRealtime` and is not comparable to a
frame's `sentAt`. Counted with the sig-window rejections under `loraSuppressed`. `BleConnectArbiter` lets
the board dial pause the mesh BLE scan for its connect window (scanning starves connects).

**Reconnect (ADR 2026-09.hp88).** A lost board gets three **direct** dials (`autoConnect = false`, 30 s, arbiter
held). After that the dial goes **background** (`autoConnect = true`, no arbiter while waiting): the controller
connects at low duty when the board advertises, with one direct dial an hour as the net for stacks whose
autoConnect never fires. The wait reads as `Disconnected("waiting for the board")`. A session Ready for 5 min
resets the streak. A background refusal is `Failed` and backs off; only a spent window skips the backoff. The
dial closes its GATT client on every non-`Opened` exit, cancellation included. While the link is down the pacer
parks on `link.state`, never on its 1 s idle tick (#67).

## Limiters that outlive the process (ADR 2026-09.7svb)

**A limiter that resets on launch is not a limiter.** Five of them are persisted through `LoraPlaneState`
(a JSON blob under one settings key, `LoraPlaneStateStore`; `mesh/lora/` itself stays Android-free): the
airtime ledger, the profile beacon's floor, the gossip Trickle interval, the per-publisher serve cap and the
12 h `profileSeen` gate. Every one of them used to begin each launch empty, so a restart handed the plane a
**fresh 45-second allowance** and re-ran every first-time behaviour against it — a self beacon, an OFFER at
the Trickle floor rather than at the back-off the silence had earned, and a `reofferTo` batch per peer as
each was heard "first" again. The duty cycle is law rather than politeness (ADR 067) and the ledger is the
only thing enforcing it, so a crash loop, a force-stop or a lab reinstall cycle spent air nothing accounted
for.

- **Stamps are wall-clock, converted at each end** (`WallShift`). `clock` is `elapsedRealtime`, which
  restarts at zero every boot: persisted directly it reads as the far future and ages nothing out. A
  snapshot stamped *ahead* of the wall clock is refused whole — the clock moved backwards, and one fresh
  window is the smaller error.
- **Nothing transmits until it is back** (`awaitRestored`, on the pacer, `gossipLoop` and `beaconProfile`).
  It releases on failure and behind a 5 s timeout: a store that never answers costs a window, not the plane.
- **A booking carries its recorded cost, not its size** — a board swapped between two processes has a
  different preset, and the air was spent at the old one.
- **The gossip Trickle interval is NOT persisted, and that was tried.** Carrying the back-off stalls the ADR
  044 election: an OFFER is the only evidence anyone has a board, `LoraGatewayPolicy` is not persisted
  (`quiesce` calls `forget`), and a restored interval that has since elapsed makes `ensureInterval` double it
  and draw a fresh point — so the first OFFER lands up to 15 min out with every gateway ACTIVE and fanning
  out everything. Lab fleet, 2026-09-10: `gossip=600000ms` restored, no OFFER in 90 s, P7 and P9 both
  `gatewaysHeard: 0` beside `boardsHeard: 1`. A fresh timer offers within 2.5–5 min, and that OFFER is
  charged to the persisted window — which is all the back-off was buying.
- **`sigSeen` and `lastHeardAt` are deliberately not persisted.** A restored `sigSeen` would carry "we
  transmitted" across a restart, which on a plane with no acks is not evidence anyone heard (the ADR
  2026-09.y8pu reasoning); a restored `lastHeardAt` would claim `reachable` on evidence this process never
  saw (ADR 2026-09.2ajk). The restored ledger bounds what both would otherwise let through.
- Writes are debounced 2 s behind a conflated wake (the pacer's 3 s floor bounds the rate anyway), plus one
  on `stop()` taken **before** `quiesce()` empties the serve budgets. A kill inside the debounce loses the
  last packet or two of the ledger. The restore runs **once per instance**: an in-process stop/start keeps
  the live ledger rather than re-reading a staler blob.

> **The pacer's monitor is taken outside the ledger's, never the other way round.** `LoraPacePolicy`,
> `LoraAirtime` and `LoraGossipPolicy` are all `@Synchronized` on every entry point, because the queue has
> six writers on five coroutines (`take` on the pacer; `enqueue` on whichever coroutine sent; `onQueueStatus`
> / `evictOversize` / `onNak` on the link, queue and outcomes collectors) and the ledger has a seventh — the

> kills the pacer coroutine and silences the plane while it still reports `state: Ready`. Nothing restarts

## DMs (ADR 039)

A 1:1 DM rides as its ordinary sealed frame — nothing is re-encoded, the signature verifies unchanged, and
the far side needs only the pinned profile (key + `CAP_RATCHET` + prekey) the beacon already carries; X3DH
attaches its init to every frame until the first reply, so no round trip is needed. The epoch ratchet
tolerates a lossy hop by design (independent epochs, ≤ 200 skipped keys per epoch). Sizes
(`CoordinationPlaneSizeBudgetTest.sealedDmsFitTheLoraHop`): a 100-char DM compacts to **387 B** steady-state
and **439 B** with the init — 2 packets either way; the 3-packet ceiling (681 B) is ≈ 400 characters steady /
≈ 335 with the init; an attachment *reference* costs ~167 B more and still fits; a `TextLimits.MESSAGE`-length
DM is `loraTooBig` and rides the radios/custody. The ✓✓ is the recipient's sealed `CTL_RECEIPT` — a DM-form
frame originated `relay = true`, so it crosses back on the same rule, and it re-runs on every re-delivery via
the pre-decrypt exists-gate (which is how a tick lost over LoRa heals when the DM is re-offered). Between two
builds that read crypto scheme v3 (ADR 059) every sealed DM-form frame is ~30 B lighter (derived nonce,
compact plaintext), and through ADR 060's `0x05` transcoder the signed, custodied DM ✓✓ crosses in **one
packet** (221 B at 228/231/255), a sealed reaction with a single-code-point emoji in one at 231 (a skin-tone,
flag or ZWJ-sequence reaction is two — 261 B for the longest RGI sequence, 290 B at the `TextLimits.REACTION`
cap — never three), the profile bootstrap in two at 228 instead
of three; AckSync's `relay = false` tick for a room or group post crosses **unsigned as one packet** (157 B
transcoded, ~218 B on `0x03`; at the MTU-255 ESP32 boards the latter needs the measured cap, `TORADIO_OVERHEAD` 27 → 228-B payloads, pinned by `CoordinationPlaneSizeBudgetTest`; verified on the
lab Pixel 9's MTU-255 ESP32 board 2026-08-29 — `lora ready … mtu=255 maxPayload=228`, fragmented 228-B writes accepted).

**Re-offer on first hearing.** The plane has no custody sync, so a DM sent while the peer's board was off
would be lost to it. On first hearing a peer (once per 45-min linger), after the beacon, the transport pulls
`FarPeerFrameSource.framesFor(peer)` (`MeshManager`: the newest 4 live custody frames addressed to the peer
via `ForwardStore.liveFramesTo`, minus our own frames it already acked via `MessageDao.unackedDmsTo`),
re-wraps them verbatim and enqueues them class DM through a private path (`reofferTo`). Skipped for a peer
another plane carries (`foreignReachable`) — custody syncs to it for real there. Bounded: ≤ 4 frames × ≤ 3
packets per sighting; a frame fanned inside the sig window is skipped. Counted as `loraReoffered`.

**What still doesn't cross:** group chat (group-form frames are refused; sealed group *machinery* — seeds,
key req/ack, escalated ticks — crosses opaquely and is bounded by the group logic), `typing`, attachment
bytes (a DM with an image arrives as text plus a loading placeholder until a radio/spool path exists —
`blobreq` never rides LoRa; `AttachmentDeferPolicy` already ignores LoRa sightings), and DMs beyond the
size ceiling. A board-less recipient behind another board-holder gets live DMs via that phone's relay but
no re-offer (no routing table).

**The ✓✓ is coalesced (ADR 054).** A DM that arrived over the board does not seal its receipt at once:
`InboundPipeline.acknowledge` holds it in `mesh/DmAckCoalescer` for ≤ 45 s (anchored on the oldest held id;
re-deliveries inside the hold add nothing), then `MeshManager.flushDmAcks` originates **one** sealed tick
(`ack`/`acks`, ≤ 12 ids — pinned to fit 3 packets at the ESP32 cap), hinted `TICK`. If we send the author a
DM meanwhile, `sendChat` carries up to 4 pending ids inline as `MessageContent.acks` on the plain DM instead
(`Protocol.CAP_INLINE_ACK` on the author's profile; 23 B each reserved out of the composer's LoRa body budget
so a reply can never become `loraTooBig` to save a tick; a v1 fallback gives them back) and no tick goes out.
DMs off the phone radios keep the instant receipt; an author who cannot read a sealed tick keeps the cleartext
form. Airtime: ~2 packets per DM; a receipt is ~0.2 s riding a reply, ~3 s standalone — an exchange costs
~4 s of the 45-s window instead of ~7 s. `heal()` is the flush backstop; a process death inside the hold
loses the pending acks and the peer's next re-offer heals it. Counted `loraTickDeferred`, `receiptsCoalesced`.

**Metadata.** Content stays end-to-end sealed, but a DM's cleartext `senderId`/`recipientId`, timing and
size now travel on the public-PSK rendezvous channel at kilometre range. `SettingsStore.loraDmEnabled`
(default **on**, the "Private messages over LoRa" switch on the LoRa radio screen, `…debug.LORA --ez dms`)
rides into `LoraConfig.dms`; off, the transport refuses DM-form on fan-out and skips the re-offer while the
room keeps riding. Each side gates its own sends. The confidentiality fix remains the deferred private PSK.

## Board provisioning (Knit configures the board)

`LoraMeshTransport.provisionKnitChannel()` (the settings button "Set up this board for Knit", or
`…debug.LORAPROV`) configures the board over the Meshtastic **admin** API so the user never hand-configures
anything. The mechanics, all inside `MeshtasticSession` (serialized with sends): an admin `get_channel` to
the local node (`to = myNodeNum`, portnum ADMIN=6, `want_response`) yields the `session_passkey` (field 101,
300 s TTL) that every following write echoes; then `begin_edit_settings` → the writes → `commit_edit_settings`.
The commit reboots the board to apply the edit, so the session ends (reset backoff) and re-handshakes,
reloading the channel table; the result returns as soon as the writes are accepted. A
`Routing.ADMIN_BAD_SESSION_KEY` NAK triggers one fresh-passkey retry of the whole transaction. **What** gets
written is the next section.

**`KnitChannel`** (`mesh/lora/KnitChannel.kt`): name `"Knit"`, 16-byte AES128 PSK **derived** (pinned +
guarded by `KnitChannelTest`) via `HKDF-SHA256(ikm="nearby", salt=0³², info="knit/lora/channel/psk/v1")`.
The seed is public, so the PSK is public — deliberately: the Nearby room is cleartext, so this channel is a
**rendezvous** (any two Knit boards converge with zero coordination), not a confidentiality boundary. Knit's
per-frame Ed25519 signatures remain the integrity boundary. A confidential per-deployment PSK (shared
out-of-band via a channel QR/URL) is deferred — see `roadmap.md`.

## Setting a board up (ADR 045)

A board is **either set up for Knit or a stock Meshtastic node** — there is no lighter option and no
hand-editable channel index, so every Knit board is configured identically and any two meet without
coordination. `provisionKnitChannel(ProvisionMode.Setup)` — the "Set up this board for Knit" button, or
`…debug.LORAPROV` — does all of it in one `begin_edit`/`commit_edit` transaction after three reads:

1. `get_config(DEVICE)`, `get_config(POSITION)`, `get_module_config(TELEMETRY)` — **before** the transaction.
   `AdminModule::handleSetConfig` assigns the whole sub-config, so every write is a read-modify-write over the
   board's own bytes (`spliceVarintFields`, `ProtoIo.kt`): only the intended fields change and everything this
   codec does not model (`role`, `gps_mode`, `tzdef`, …) is copied through byte-for-byte. A read that fails
   aborts with nothing written.
2. `set_channel { index N, settings { psk, name "Knit", module_settings {} }, role = SECONDARY }` into the
   lowest free secondary slot (1..7), reusing an existing Knit channel wherever it already sits. **Index 0 is
   never touched** — see the note above. The empty `module_settings` **is** `position_precision = 0`; an
   absent one reads as "unset" and the firmware defaults to full precision.
3. `set_config` / `set_module_config` stretching `node_info_broadcast_secs`, `position_broadcast_secs` (smart
   broadcast cleared) and `telemetry.device_update_interval` to `BoardQuiet.QUIET_SECS` (6 h), and setting
   `rebroadcast_mode = LOCAL_ONLY` so the board keeps relaying its own channels — all ADR 044's bridge needs —
   and stops spending its battery repeating the rest of the band. The GPS itself is not touched: silencing
   what the board *broadcasts* is Knit's business, powering down the user's hardware is not.
4. `set_owner` writing the board's **Knit identity** (`BoardOwner`/`BoardName`): the long name
   **`Knit abcd`** / short name **`Knit`** (ADR 049) — the suffix is the low two bytes of its node number,
   the same shape the firmware's own `Meshtastic abcd` default uses, so two boards in one pocket stay
   distinguishable — plus **`is_unmessagable`** (ADR 2026-09.emd7). Read first (`get_owner_request`,
   **before** the transaction, like the configs) and spliced over the board's own bytes,
   `spliceStringFields` for the names then `spliceVarintFields` for the mark. Never composed from scratch:
   `handleSetOwner` merges rather than assigns, and **both** its bools are cleared by an omission —
   `is_licensed` has no presence at all (and takes `override_duty_cycle` with it), while `is_unmessagable`
   has presence yet is still assigned whenever the two presence bits differ. Deliberately **not** the user's
   display name — a `NodeInfo` is cleartext on the public frequency.

   **The mark says what the board already is.** Knit's intake keeps only `PRIVATE_APP`, so a stranger's
   `TEXT_MESSAGE_APP` DM to a Knit board is ACKed by the firmware's routing layer and then dropped unseen —
   a *delivered* tick against a message nobody will read. Clients that honour the flag grey the node out
   instead. It is a `NodeInfo` hint and changes no routing, which is why it is this and **not**
   `device.role = CLIENT_MUTE`: that would stop rebroadcast outright, and ADR 044's bridge needs
   `LOCAL_ONLY`'s own-channel relaying. Gated on firmware **2.6.9** (`BoardName.honoursUnmessagable`), where
   the plumbing landed; older boards drop field 9 and never echo it back, so writing it would leave the
   setup looking permanently unfinished. A version that will not parse counts as **too old** — the opposite
   of `LoraAirtime.signsPackets`' reading of the same string, because here a wrong guess writes to somebody's
   hardware rather than merely over-charging for airtime.

The settings **and the identity** the board had first come back as `ProvisionResult.Provisioned.previous`
and are persisted per board (`SettingsStore.loraBoardSetup`); **Restore** writes them back and disables every
Knit channel — the mark included, since a restored board is a stock node and a stock node is read. With no
name recorded, the restore writes the one the firmware itself would have chosen
(`BoardName.stock`, unmarked) rather than leave a restored board saying Knit. It
leaves **no** Knit channel, so the caller switches the plane off with it — otherwise the next fan-out would go
out over whatever channel remains — and restoring a board that carries none is refused, since there is nothing
to undo and the config writes would push somebody's board to values it never had. Re-running the setup on a
board that already has the channel is a reported no-op **except for the identity write**: a board set up by
an older Knit — missing its name (pre-ADR 049), the unmonitored mark (pre-ADR 2026-09.emd7), or both — gets
one `set_owner` and nothing else, so the recorded settings are never overwritten with the quieted ones. The
screen offers exactly that as a single button (`lora_rename`, no confirmation — one reversible write)
whenever `LoraRadioUiState.needsRename`: the board carries the Knit channel and `BoardInfo.owner` — its own
`NodeInfo.user`, decoded off the same handshake ADR 041's battery comes from — differs from
`BoardName.forNode`'s. A board whose firmware never sends its own `NodeInfo` reports nothing and is left
alone. Two traps here:

- **The button's label depends on which half is missing.** The screen compares `meshName` against
  `knitName`: equal names mean the board is already called what Knit calls it and the *mark* is what is
  missing, so it says "Mark this board unmonitored" instead of lying about a rename.
- **`renameOnly` fills the recorded name in, it does not overwrite it** (`previous.owner ?: was.owner`). A
  board missing only the mark is *already* `Knit abcd`, and recording that would destroy the only copy of
  the stock name a Restore has to put back. Unconditional overwrite was safe only while this path was
  reachable exclusively on a stock-named board.

### The dedicated-frequency setup (ADR 067) — debug builds only

`ProvisionMode.SetupDedicated` is everything above **plus** one spliced varint: `lora.channel_num`, pinning
the radio to the slot `LoraSlot` derives instead of leaving the firmware to hash it out of the primary's name.
It exists because ADR 045's bargain has a premise — a Meshtastic neighbourhood to borrow relaying from — and
an isolated farm or a mountain house does not have one, so the shared slot buys nothing while still costing
`LoraAirtime`'s politeness ceiling. **Not offered in any release build** (`LoraRadioUiState.dedicatedOffered`
is `BuildConfig.DEBUG`, re-checked in the ViewModel so no route reaches it), and never the default.

- **The slot is derived, not asked for**: `hash(KnitChannel.NAME) % (region band / preset bandwidth)`, so two
  boards in the same region on the same preset converge with no coordination, exactly as the shared slot does.
- **An unknown band is refused, not guessed** (`ProvisionResult.NoDedicatedSlot`, nothing written): picking a
  slot means picking a transmit frequency, so `LoraRegion` carries a band only for **US** and **ANZ** — the two
  wide 100 %-duty regions this is worth doing in, un-collapsed from `OTHER`. `MIN_CHANNELS = 2` also refuses a
  band whose only slot *is* the stock one.
- **`BoardConfig.LORA` is outside `BoardConfig.QUIET` on purpose**: the ordinary setup still never reads or
  writes the radio, so ADR 045's promise survives the codec learning to address it. The board's own
  `channel_num` is recorded like every other prior value, and a restore of a board that was never pinned
  touches no radio config at all.
- **What changes on the air** is in `LoraAirtime` below, not here.
- **A pinned board has no Meshtastic room.** No public radio can hear it, so `LoraStatusRepository` folds
  `AirtimeSnapshot.dedicated` into `LoraFacts.room` (the row goes, history and all; `canPost` with it) and
  the transport closes both doors the way the room switch does (`MESH_POST_DEDICATED` inbound,
  `PublicPostRefusal.DEDICATED` outbound). Read off the governor's **sticky** verdict, never the live
  `LinkState.Ready.radio`: the setup ends in a board reboot, and the row must not come back — nor the setup
  button (`LoraRadioUiState.dedicated`) or the room switch wake up — for the seconds the link is down. The
  screen offers the button only while the board is *not* yet pinned; afterwards the line says so and
  Restore is the way back (device-observed 2026-09-17: the button had kept showing over a pinned board).

Drive it headlessly with `…debug.LORAPROV --es mode dedicated`; `--es mode restore` undoes either setup.

A board whose bound slot is **not** the Knit channel never transmits (`LoraMeshTransport.boundSlotIsKnit`,
counted as `loraSuppressed`): after a restore, or before a setup, sending would put Knit's cleartext frames
onto whatever channel the board is on — most likely the public one. A board that reports no channel table at
all is given the benefit of the doubt, since going mute on unreadable firmware is the worse failure.

**The cost, which the confirmation states out loud:** the board is renamed for Knit, is marked unmonitored
so other people's apps stop offering it as a message target, stops broadcasting its
position and node info, and stops relaying other radios' traffic. Its own main channel is left alone and it stays on the public
frequency, so nothing else about its place in the Meshtastic network changes.

Admin wire (pinned by `MeshtasticProtoTest`): `AdminMessage{ get_channel_request=1, get_channel_response=2,
get_owner_request=3, get_owner_response=4, get_config_request=5, get_config_response=6,
get_module_config_request=7, get_module_config_response=8, set_owner=32, set_channel=33, set_config=34,
set_module_config=35, begin_edit_settings=64, commit_edit_settings=65, session_passkey=101 }`;
`User{ long_name=2, short_name=3, is_unmessagable=9 }` (field 9 is `optional`, so absent and an explicit
false are two encodings — both read as messagable); `Channel{ index=1, settings=2, role=3 }` (Role SECONDARY=2, DISABLED=0);
`ChannelSettings{ psk=2, name=3, module_settings=7 }` with `ModuleSettings{ position_precision=1 }`;
`Config{ device=1, position=2 }` / `ModuleConfig{ telemetry=6 }` (the request enums number differently:
`ConfigType{ DEVICE=0, POSITION=1 }`, `ModuleConfigType{ TELEMETRY=5 }`);
`DeviceConfig{ rebroadcast_mode=6, node_info_broadcast_secs=7 }` (RebroadcastMode LOCAL_ONLY=2);
`Data.want_response=3`.

## UI surfaces (ADR 040)

- **Per message.** A frame off the board is stored `DeliveryPlane.LoRa` (`messages.receivedVia = 5`; the
  composite stamps `InboundFrame.kind`, `InboundPipeline.planeOf` maps it), and the receipt that flips our
  ✓✓ over LoRa records the same. `ui/chat/DeliveryStatus.kt` paints `Icons.Filled.Sensors` beside the ✓✓
  (`chat_tick_lora`) or on an arrival (`chat_arrived_lora`) with "Delivered over LoRa" / "Arrived over LoRa";
  the message-details screen swaps the icon the same way. Inbound rows are first-write-wins
  (`MessageDao.insertIfAbsent`), so a room post keeps the plane it first arrived on across re-serves.
- **Header.** `LoraPlane { Off, Down, Live }` (`mesh/lora/LoraPlane.kt`) from `LoraStatusRepository.facts`
  (pushed) → `ConnectionStatusRow(lora = …)`: `Icons.Outlined.Sensors` (Live, tertiary) / `SensorsOff` (Down)
  after the cloud, spoken as "LoRa radio connected / not connected"; 45 s grace on the Down edge.
- **LoRa radio screen.** `BondedBoardDirectory` marks each bonded device board-like (LE + `Meshtastic_xxxx` /
  `<short>_xxxx` / the service UUID in cache); `BoardFilter.visible` lists those plus the bound board, with
  "Show all paired devices" (`lora_show_all_boards`) for the rest; the list re-reads on resume
  (`refreshBoards`). A connected board shows the one setup section (`lora_setup` / `lora_restore`, ADR 045),
  firmware, **radios in range** (`lora_boards_heard`,
  distinct Meshtastic `packet.from` on our channel, control packets and part-fragments included) and — only
  when the two differ — **people reachable** (`lora_peers_heard`, distinct frame *authors*). The two diverge as
  soon as a gateway relays or backfills somebody else's frame, so "1 radio, 3 people" is normal; reporting only
  the author count read as phantom hardware in the field (2026-08-25: "3 peers heard" with two radios in
  existence). `LoraStatus.heard` stays the author count and remains what `reachable`/routing use. The
  Profile row reads "On · <board> · connected / not connected".
- **Chat.** `LoraNotice` (`chat_lora_notice`, `ui/chat/LoraReach.kt`) under the relay notice for a DM whose
  peer only the board has heard (`isLoraOnly(peerTransports[peer])`, plane live, not relay-covered), with a
  DMs-off variant and (ADR 054) a **saturated** variant — `LoraFacts.airtimeSpent`, ≥ 90 % of the window's
  live budget while live — that says messages are delayed; the composer's "long message" hint (`chat_lora_size_hint`) when the draft exceeds
  `LoraSizeHint`'s budget for its `LoraCarry` form (room 400 B, DM 320 B, −260 B replying, −170 B with a
  photo; pinned in `CoordinationPlaneSizeBudgetTest`).
  The **room** has its own rule, `loraRoomReachFor` → `LoraReach.RoomSaturated` (ADR 2026-09.ursc): the same spent
  window, but the audience test is existential — `peerTransports.values.any(::isLoraOnly)`, *is there anyone
  out there a full queue would delay* — because the room is addressed to nobody. It is the room's **only**
  LoRa state; there is deliberately no `LoraOnly` counterpart (the room's audience is always a mix, so a
  standing "some people are far" strip is permanent chrome saying nothing actionable), no `RelayReach` gate
  (the room is never scope-eligible, `SPOOL_PROTOCOL` §4.4, so no better carrier can exist), no `facts.dms`
  gate (the room rides whatever the DM switch says) and no dismissal (it clears itself as the rolling window
  ages air back, so "never again" would hide it exactly when it matters). Its copy names nobody and says what
  still works — everyone in phone-radio range gets the post at once.
  A **group** thread has its own rule too, `loraGroupReachFor` → `LoraReach.GroupUnsupported`
  (ADR 2026-09.6ww7), and it is the odd one out: every other notice here is congestion, this one is
  **capability** — `LoraFramePolicy` refuses group-form chat, so a member only the board can hear does not
  get these messages at all until they are back in phone-radio range or a relay carries the group scope.
  Gated on this group's **roster** (`members.any { it != me && it in loraOnlyIds }`, never the room's
  existential test — a LoRa-only stranger is not in the group), silenced by `RelayReach.Covered` (a group
  scope *is* scope-eligible where the room is not), and with no airtime or `dms` gate, both of which would
  be category errors. `ChatViewModel.LoraAudience` is the sealed `Peer`/`Room`/`Group` projection that feeds
  all three, chosen once from `Conversations.kindFor`.
  **`LoraStatus` is republished on every accepted send** (`LoraMeshTransport.sendMessage`), not only on the
  60-s linger sweep: a send is the only thing that spends the ledger, so without it the notice — and the
  radio screen's `lora_airtime` percentage — trailed the fact by up to a minute. The pacer's 3-s floor bounds
  the rate and `LoraStatusRepository` reduces the snapshot to a threshold, so no UI sees the churn.
- **Battery (ADR 041).** The board's own `DeviceMetrics` — its `FromRadio.node_info` (the entry whose `num`
  is `my_info`'s) in the handshake, then the TELEMETRY_APP packet the firmware sends the phone about once a
  minute — land in `MeshtasticLink.battery` (`BoardBattery`: `percent` / `voltage` / `powered`, folded by
  `BoardBattery.of`; a level above 100 is "plugged in", 0 with no voltage is no reading) → `LoraStatus.battery`
  → the status row's "Battery 78% · 3.92 V" / "Plugged in · 4.10 V" (`lora_battery`, error-coloured at ≤ 20 %)
  and the Profile row's "· battery 78%" while live (`LoraFacts.battery`, never a reach input). Never polled;
  cleared with the link.
- **Seam.** UI code reaches the transport only through `LoraPlaneStatus` (`status`, `provisionKnitChannel`),
  bound to `LoraMeshTransport` under `BuildConfig.LORA_PLANE` and to `LoraPlaneStatus.Dark` otherwise.

## The Meshtastic room (slot 0 mirror, ADR 2026-09.26q3)

The paired board's **primary (slot 0) channel**, mirrored into `Conversations.MESHTASTIC` on this phone and
this phone only. It is a simple interface to the board's own broadcast chat — whatever preset, name or key the
user gave slot 0 — and **nothing in it ever crosses Knit's mesh**: no frame, no custody, no fan-out, no
gateway election on either direction. A phone with no board never sees these posts; two phones with boards
each hear the channel for themselves.

- **The switch** (ADR 2026-09.x52a). `SettingsStore.loraRoomEnabled`, **default on**, on the LoRa settings
  screen beside the DM and bridge switches, and carried to the transport as `LoraConfig.room`. Off, the
  slot-0 branch of `onLoraPacket` **returns before `onPrimaryPacket`** — so `judge`, the name lookup, the
  XEdDSA verify, the contact resolution, the moderator, the row and its notification are all never reached,
  counted as `meshPostRefusedByReason.ROOM_OFF` while `meshPostHeard` stays at zero — `postToPublicChannel`
  refuses `ROOM_OFF`, and `ChatListViewModel` drops the room's row **including its history** (the rows stay
  in the database and return with the switch). `LoraFacts.room` is the user's answer *alone*, never folded
  with the plane the way `dms` is, because the row is drawn from history as well as from a live board;
  `canPost` folds both. Knit's own frames on the bound slot are untouched. Toggling off also calls
  `Notifier.clearConversation` so nothing already on the shade outlives the row. `…debug.LORA --ez room false`.
- **Inbound.** `LoraMeshTransport.onLoraPacket` routes a channel-0 `TEXT_MESSAGE_APP` packet — by portnum,
  never by the bound index, which defaults to 0 on a board that never ran the setup — to `onPrimaryPacket` →
  `PublicChannelPolicy.judge` (broadcast, text, a packet id, a body; `OWN_BOARD` refuses our own board's echo
  and `KNIT_ON_PRIMARY` the lab shape where slot 0 *is* the Knit channel, decided off the channel table) →
  `MeshPostSink.onPublicPostHeard` → `InboundPipeline.deliverMeshPost`, which writes the row through the
  ordinary `deliverChat` (room moderation, one notification, `ack = false`). The row's `senderId` is **this
  phone** by convention and `originNode != null` is what says the words are somebody else's; its id is
  `FrameId.forMeshPost(node, packetId)` so the board replaying its queue on reconnect is a no-op. Counters:
  `meshPostHeard` / `Ingested` / `ViaMqtt` / `Matched` / `RefusedByReason`.
- **Outbound.** `MeshManager.sendPublicPost` → room moderation → `PublicChannelSink.postToPublicChannel`
  (`NOT_READY`, `KNIT_ON_PRIMARY`, the 30 s `PUBLIC_POST_FLOOR_MS` claimed at the decision, `TOO_LARGE`,
  `AirBucket.PUBLIC` at 15 % of the window) → `Destination.Public` on the shared pacer → channel 0,
  `TEXT_MESSAGE_APP`, `HOP_LIMIT`, the line composed by `PublicPostPolicy.onAirText` — the user's words
  alone, **with no author name in front of them** (ADR 2026-09.9469 withdrew ADR 049's one exception: the
  board is the identity now that each phone posts through its own). Still behind
  `SettingsStore.meshtasticPostConsented`, whose sheet says what does travel — the board's own `Knit abcd`,
  which anyone holding the user's contact card reads back as them. The own row is stored **only** once the
  board queued it (`DeliveryPlane.LoRa`, never a ✓✓); a `PublicPostOutcome.Refused` reaches the composer as a
  toast with the draft kept, so a post never silently goes nowhere. `…debug.SEND --es conv m-public` drives it.
- **Contacts.** The profile carries the bound board's node number (`ProfileContent.loraNode`, persisted as
  `SettingsStore.loraBoard` when the board reports `Ready`, cleared on unbind, republished on change);
  `PeerEntity.loraNode` stores a peer's claim; `deliverMeshPost` resolves `packet.from` through
  `PeerRepository.findByLoraNode` (newest `updatedAt` wins — a board that changed hands is claimed twice until
  the old holder's next profile drops it) **once, at ingest**, and freezes it as `messages.originPeerId`, so
  history is never re-attributed. A resolved contact wears their name and avatar with the **unverified**
  styling (muted name, untappable avatar, the room strip) until a signature verifies the match — then a Knit
  author's colour, a shield and a direct avatar tap; a blocked contact's board is dropped
  (`BLOCKED_CONTACT`). A row's body is shown word for word, since ADR 2026-09.9469 left nothing on the line
  but the words — a heard `"Sam: hi"` is a stranger's content, not a prefix to strip. The match rests on a
  self-asserted node number — **unless the signature checks out** (ADR 2026-09.ggq4). The profile also
  carries the board's Curve25519 key (`ProfileContent.loraKey` ← `SettingsStore.loraBoard.key`, written with
  the number in one edit, read with it from one snapshot, and only while the board signs), `peers.loraKey` stores it, and `deliverMeshPost`
  verifies a signed post on the phone (`mesh/crypto/XeddsaVerify`, over `from ‖ id ‖ portnum ‖ payload` as
  heard — `MeshPost.payload`, never the trimmed body) and freezes the verdict on the row as
  `messages.originSigned`: `UNSIGNED` (nothing to say — pre-2.8 radios never sign, a post past the cliff
  cannot), `SIGNED_BY_BOARD` (our board's `xeddsa_signed`: the radio that has been using the number), `SIGNED_BY_CONTACT`
  (verified under the contact's advertised key — the one verified state) and `SIGNATURE_MISMATCH` (some other
  radio on the contact's number: **not attributed**, drawn as a stranger that says so). Counters:
  `meshPostVerified` / `BoardVerified` / `SignatureMismatch`.
- **Signable cap.** On a board that signs (`LoraFacts.signs`) the composer caps a post at
  `PublicPostPolicy.MAX_SIGNED_TEXT_BYTES` (166, `MeshtasticProto.maxSignedPayload(PORT_TEXT_MESSAGE)`) so
  every post leaves signed, else the 200-byte client convention; `postToPublicChannel` trims to the same
  `onAirBudget(signing)`. Knit-frame padding (ADR 2026-09.mhs5) is untouched.
- **Verified on hardware (2026-09-05, ADR 2026-09.ggq4):** Pixel 7 on `!64761b18` and Pixel 9 on
  `!e681a7c3` (both 2.8.0.47db0e3), a post each way — the far phone's `LoraMeshTransport` log reads
  `lora public post from !… signed=true boardVerified=true`, `…debug.LORA` counts `meshPostMatched` /
  `meshPostVerified` and no mismatch, and the room draws the shield; a 166-byte post (`lora tx public 166B`)
  arrived signed and verified, so the text cliff holds. The oracle is the phone itself: `…debug.SEND --es
  conv m-public` to post, the transport log and the counters to read, no serial needed (and `!e681a7c3` is
  the Pixel 9's own board — a serial session on it wedges that phone's BLE link). Not seen on hardware: a
  mismatch or a board-only verdict, for want of a third signer on this mesh. The raw `FromRadio` capture
  (`.private/scripts/meshtastic-fromradio-capture.py`) is the serial-side oracle when a non-phone board is
  free.
- **UI.** `LoraFacts.primaryChannel` / `canPost` (only while Live) title the room and the chat-list row
  (`meshRoomChannel`: live board → newest post's channel → "Meshtastic"), the row exists while a board is
  bound or history remains, and `PublicPostGate` swaps the composer for a footer with no radio bound (or a
  Knit-at-0 board) and only changes the hint while the link is down, so the keyboard survives a BLE flap.
  Notifications key on the resolved contact (or the `!hex` id, never `me`), stay `IMPORTANCE_LOW`, and carry
  no inline reply. The composer hint and the pinned strip both say the room is outside Knit's encryption as
  well as unverified, since it is drawn like every other thread and a reader who never opens the dialog would
  carry Knit's padlock into a channel that has none. How strongly is read off slot 0's own key
  (`PublicChannelPolicy.primaryKeyIsPublic` → `LoraFacts.primaryKeyIsPublic` → `ChatUiState`): a psk of one
  byte or none is Meshtastic's published default family, so that channel is **unencrypted**; a 16- or 32-byte
  psk is the user's own key, shared with every radio holding it and still **not end-to-end encrypted**.
  Unknown — no table, or the link down — reads as public, because the two mistakes do not cost the same.
  `MeshRoomNotice` is the room's **only** pinned strip: `reachFor` answers
  `RelayReach.Silent` for `Conversations.MESHTASTIC` ahead of every other rule, so no relay notice ever
  appears here. The exclusion is structural like the Nearby room's, but it earns no copy at all — these posts
  never enter Knit's mesh, so no relay could carry them under any configuration, and "not covered by relays
  yet" promised a coverage that is never coming.

### A DM to the board is answered once (ADR 2026-09.4n5p)

A `TEXT_MESSAGE_APP` packet **addressed to the board** (`to == myNodeNum`) is a Meshtastic user's DM, and
nothing on this phone reads it — ADR 2026-09.emd7's `is_unmessagable` mark says so to the clients that
honour it, but the DM still arrives and the firmware ACKs it, so the sender saw a delivered tick against
words nobody read. `onLoraPacket` now routes it, **ahead of the room's branch and on the portnum + address
alone** (a 2.5+ board reports a PKI DM on index 0 whatever slot the sender used; current firmware refuses a
channel-keyed DM at decode), to `onDirectMessage` → `DmAutoReplyPolicy.judge` → one fixed line
(`DmAutoReplyPolicy.TEXT`, 149 B ASCII: unmonitored, nobody reads it, part of a Knit mesh, getknit.app)
queued as `Destination.Reply` — the room's own write with the sender's number in `OutboundFrame.to`, so
`Router::perhapsEncode` PKI-encrypts it to their key. `MeshtasticLink.send(to =)` is the only unicast the
plane ever sends.

- **Gates, counted by name** (`autoReplyRefusedByReason`): the room's `DEDICATED` (ADR 067) and
  `KNIT_ON_PRIMARY`, plus `NOT_SET_UP` — the bound slot must carry the Knit channel, and an **empty**
  channel table reads as not set up (the opposite of `boundSlotIsKnit`'s reading for Knit's own frames),
  because the setup's confirmation sheet is where the user consented to the board saying it is
  unmonitored. No settings switch, and the room switch does not gate it.
- **Politeness**: `PER_SENDER_MS` = 24 h per node (`SeenSet` of 256, keyed `!hex`), `FLOOR_MS` = 30 s for
  anybody on its own timestamp (never shared with `lastPublicPostAt`), the `PUBLIC` air share asked at the
  decision (`NO_AIR`, never queued), priced as a signed post (over-charges a PKI unicast by ~54 B — the
  conservative error). The floor is asked **before** the sender is stamped, so a `TOO_SOON` sender's next
  message still earns the reply; a `REPLIED_RECENTLY` one is silence for the day, which is what breaks a
  loop with a neighbour's bot. The per-sender memory persists in `LoraPlaneSnapshot.autoReplied` — the
  board replays its queue on reconnect, and a restart is a reconnect.
- **Not on hardware yet.** Needs a stock third node DMing a Knit board; the oracle is `…debug.LORA`'s
  `autoReplyHeard` / `autoReplySent` and the reply on the stock node's screen, PKI (the padlock) and once.
  The rig trap: `FakeMeshtasticLink` is node `1u`, so a test DM `from = 0x1u` is `OWN_BOARD`.

## Board setup (once, Meshtastic CLI or app)

Flash `firmware-heltec-v4-<ver>`; `--set lora.region <US|EU_868|…>`; `--set network.wifi_enabled false`;
`--set bluetooth.enabled true --set bluetooth.mode RANDOM_PIN`; same `lora.modem_preset` (LongFast) on
both. **Nothing else needs hand-setup** — pair the board in Knit, then tap "Set up this board for Knit" (or
`…debug.LORAPROV`) on each phone: the channel and the housekeeping both follow from that one action, and
there is no hand-picked channel index any more (the debug bridge keeps `--ei channel <idx>` for lab work).
Leave each board's **primary channel at its default** — renaming it moves the radio to another frequency,
where no other Knit board is listening. Set the Meshtastic app's device to **None** /
`adb shell am force-stop com.geeksville.mesh`.

## On-device verification (physical devices only, with an explicit go-ahead — `rules/devices.md`)

- Pair: Profile → LoRa radio → pick the bonded board → status `Ready`. `adb logcat -s MeshtasticGatt
  MeshtasticLink LoraMeshTransport`: `lora dial … bonded=true` → `mtu 517` → `handshake nonce=…` →
  `my_info !… pio=heltec-v4` → `config complete` → `ready`.
- Battery: the status row shows the reading with `ready` (the handshake's `node_info`) and refreshes within a
  minute; unplug USB and "Plugged in" becomes a percentage on the next telemetry, replug and it flips back.
- Signal: the row reads the freshest `RxQuality` in `boardsHeardAt` — **only radios that sent a Knit frame on
  the bound channel**, keyed per radio, aged out with the radio at the 45-minute linger and dropped on `stop()`.
  It must never be taken in `MeshtasticSession`: that runs ahead of the portnum/channel filter, and the board
  hands the phone the whole air. On a stock board (primary left at the public default, ADR 045) that is mostly
  strangers three to seven hops out at the noise floor, plus a synthetic POSITION/TELEMETRY per NodeDB entry
  replayed at **every** handshake carrying a stale per-node SNR and no RSSI at all. Reading the last of those
  decayed a real +6 dB / -7 dBm board-to-board link to -17 dB / -105 dBm within minutes and latched it there,
  which looked exactly like a radio going deaf and cleared on a board reboot. Field oracle: `…debug.LORATX`
  from the other phone snaps the row back within a second, while `meshtastic --listen` on the board shows the
  two populations side by side.
- Set the boards up (ADR 045): `…debug.LORAPROV` (or the screen's "Set up this board for Knit") on **both**
  phones → log `lora provision set up chN 'Knit'`, the board reboots, and the link returns. Then, over USB
  with the Meshtastic app disconnected: (1) `meshtastic --info` on both boards reports the **same, unchanged**
  frequency and an untouched primary channel — the setup must never move the radio; (2) a Nearby post crosses
  and `loraNak == 0`; (3) the **battery row still refreshes within a minute**, which is what proves stretching
  the *mesh* telemetry interval did not silence the phone-only telemetry ADR 041 reads (if it did, that
  interval is the wrong lever); (4) `meshtastic --get device.role`, `--get lora.region`,
  `--get position.gps_mode` are unchanged from before while `--get device.rebroadcast_mode` now reads
  `LOCAL_ONLY` — the read-modify-write proof; (5) a post crosses further than either board's own range when a
  stock node sits between them — the free-repeater effect this design is built on; (6) `…debug.LORAPROV --es
  mode restore` leaves no Knit channel, every setting back at its pre-setup value, and the LoRa switch off.
- Provision the channel: tap "Set up this board for Knit" (or `…debug.LORAPROV`) on **both** phones → log
  `lora provision wrote chN 'Knit'` (or `reuse`) → the board reboots and the link reconnects → the channel
  index in settings now points at the Knit slot. Both boards must be provisioned before frames cross.
- `…debug.LORA` (debug bridge): `--es address <MAC>` + `--es name <n>` binds a board, `--ei channel <idx>`,
  `--ez on <true|false>`, `--ez bridge <true|false>`; no extras dumps
  `state/boardNodeNum/snr/rssi/queueFree/queued/heard/role/pocketLinks/pocketSightings/gatewaysHeard/radio/airtime/counters`
  (`airtime` also carries `dedicated`, true when the board is on its own RF slot and so off the politeness
  ceiling — ADR 067; `liveMs`/`bridgeMs`/`bootstrapMs` against their budgets — `loraSent − loraDmSent −
  loraOfferSent` is the profile + room count, which holds only because `loraOfferSent` counts what was
  **transmitted** rather than what was enqueued (ADR 2026-09.t8t8), and profiles are the fragmented ones;
  `loraProfileRefanSkipped` against `loraSent` is the re-fan redundancy). `loraAirtimeHeld` /
  `loraAirtimeHeldByBucket` beside `queued` is what tells a starved plane from a quiet one: a spent bucket
  *holds* frames rather than dropping them, so no counter moves until the queue overflows and the drops all
  arrive at once. It is the
  two-board oracle. `…debug.LORATX --es text <s>` sends a raw payload straight to the board (board-side
  sanity via `meshtastic --noproto`). `…debug.LORAPROV` sets the board up headlessly; `--es mode dedicated`
  is ADR 067's debug-only dedicated-frequency setup and `--es mode restore` undoes either.
- Broadcast: `…debug.SEND --es conv nearby --es text …` on A → appears on B within ~5–10 s; A's tick flips
  ✓✓ (sealed tick over LoRa); a reaction crosses. Move B out of BLE/NAN range and repeat. Counters:
  `loraSent/loraReceived/loraReassembled` climb, `loraNak == 0`, `loraDroppedQueue == 0` at chat pace,
  `loraTooBig` only for long posts. Diagnostics lists a LoRa-reachable node under **Reachable long-range**
  tagged `LoRa`, never under *Directly connected* (ADR 2026-09.2ajk).
- DM (ADR 039): `…debug.SEND --es conv <peerId> --es text …` on A → appears on B within ~10 s; A's tick
  flips ✓✓ (the sealed receipt crossed back); `loraDmSent`/`loraDmReceived` climb on both, `loraTooBig == 0`.
  Reply from B (turnaround epoch) and a DM reaction cross; a 500-char DM counts `loraTooBig` and lands later
  over BLE. Power B's board off, send two DMs from A, power it on → B beacons, A logs `reoffer` ×2, both land,
  ✓✓ returns, `loraReoffered == 2`. `…debug.LORA --ez dms false` on A → a new DM stays LoRa-silent
  (`loraDmSent` flat) while a room post crosses. Rejoin a BLE clique after an hour of history:
  `loraSuppressed` climbs, `loraDroppedQueue` stays 0.

- Airtime (ADR 054), the three-phone trial: A + C linked over BLE, B far over LoRa, boards on A and B. (1) A ↔ C
  text 20 messages over BLE → on A `loraSkippedLinked` climbs by ~40 (DMs + ✓✓s), `loraSent` and
  `airtime.liveMs` stay flat, ✓✓ instant, B's board hears nothing. (2) A ↔ B text over LoRa: each ✓✓ lands on A
  within ~45 s or with B's reply; `loraTickDeferred`/`receiptsCoalesced` climb; a burst of three from A yields
  one tick from B. (3) A burst past the window: `airtime.liveMs` reaches `liveBudgetMs`, the chat notice
  appears on A for B **on the spending send, not a minute later** (the publish-on-send above), the **Nearby
  room** on A carries its own `RoomSaturated` notice for as long as B is LoRa-only, `loraDroppedQueue == 0`,
  the queue drains within 15 min, ticks yield first. Link B over BLE and the room notice goes quiet while
  `airtime.liveMs` stays put — the room speaks about a delayed audience, not about the ledger alone.
  (4) `loraNak == 0` throughout, EU boards included.
- Bridge (ADR 044), the four-device trial: pocket A = board-holder + one more phone, pocket B likewise, the
  two pockets out of BLE/NAN range of each other. `…debug.LORA` shows `role: ACTIVE` on both board-holders and
  a real `radio` (region/preset off the board, not `(assumed)`). (1) A room post from A's **board-less** phone
  reaches B's board-less phone in ~10 s — `loraSent`/`loraReceived` climb on the gateways only. (2) Power B's
  board off, post twice in A, wait past `FRESH_MS` (15 min), power it back on → B offers, A logs
  `lora bridge served=2`, both land, `loraBridged == 2`. (3) Pair a third board to A's second phone → it
  reports `role: PASSIVE`, `loraPassive` climbs, its `loraSent` stays flat, and the bridge keeps working.
  (4) Over an hour of chat pace: `airtime.liveMs` under `liveBudgetMs`, `bridgeMs` under `bridgeBudgetMs`,
  `loraNak == 0`, `loraDroppedQueue == 0`. (5) `…debug.LORA --ez bridge false` → `loraOfferSent` stops
  climbing and no backfill is served, while a live room post still crosses. (6) With `bridgeMs` at its budget
  from serving, `lora tx offer` still appears on the gossip schedule and `loraOfferSent` matches that line
  count; `loraAirtimeHeld` names `BRIDGE` while `queued` shows the depth, and `loraBridged` stops short of
  `SERVE_CAP_PER_HOUR` rather than running to it with nothing landing (ADR 2026-09.t8t8). (7) `gossipMs`
  climbs with the offers while `bridgeMs` does not, and a `served=0/4 (n over budget)` round is followed by
  a cheaper frame crossing in the same round rather than a second `0/4`; each refusal names its own frame as
  `lora bridge held bridge:<id>: <n>ms + <n>ms queued, BRIDGE <used>/<budget>` (ADR 2026-09.7c8n).

## First-session unknowns to confirm (assumptions, not blockers)

Whether an empty FromRadio read returns immediately or blocks ~20 s (could cut the 30 s read timeout);
`phone_timeout_secs` default (180 s heartbeat is safe either way); whether `queueStatus` is pushed as the
TX queue drains; that `mesh_packet_id` echoes our client id; that PRIVATE_APP packets reach the phone and
our own broadcast is not echoed; the 600 ms bonded post-connect settle (drop if unneeded).
