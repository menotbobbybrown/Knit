# Toolchain (bleeding-edge — do not "fix" these without reading why)

This project intentionally runs on very new tooling (AGP 9.4.1, Gradle 9.7.1, Kotlin 2.4.20,
Compose BOM 2026.09.00, compileSdk 37.1). That forces several non-obvious choices. **Read this before
changing build config, dependencies, or the DI graph.**

## compileSdk is what gates AAR upgrades — check `minCompileSdk`, not the version number

`compileSdk` is `release(37) { minorApiLevel = 1 }` (37.2 is in the transparency log but not yet in
F-Droid's buildserver image — see below). An AAR whose
`aar-metadata.properties` declares a *higher* `minCompileSdk` **cannot** be consumed at all — the build
fails in `checkDebugAarMetadata`, not at compile. androidx now moves this gate aggressively (the whole
API-37 wave — core-ktx 1.19.0, lifecycle 2.11.0, Compose UI 1.12.0, okhttp-android 5.5.0 — is exactly
why compileSdk moved off 36.1). Before bumping any AAR dependency, read its metadata:

```sh
curl -sO "https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/<group/path>/<artifact>/<ver>/<artifact>-<ver>.aar"
unzip -p <artifact>-<ver>.aar META-INF/com/android/build/gradle/aar-metadata.properties
```

Two traps that version numbers hide:

- **Check the artifacts this app actually uses, not the group's headline one.** lifecycle 2.11.0's
  `lifecycle-runtime` is minCompileSdk 34; its `lifecycle-viewmodel-compose` is 37. The strictest one wins.
- **A JVM-looking coordinate can still resolve to an AAR.** `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp` publishes an
  `androidRuntimeElements` variant whose `available-at` redirects to `okhttp-android`, so an Android
  consumer gets that AAR's `minCompileSdk`. Inspect `<artifact>-<ver>.module`, not just the `.pom`.

`compileSdk` sets only which APIs the compiler *sees*. Runtime behavior is `targetSdk`, deliberately held
at **36** — moving it opts into a new release's behavior changes and starts a Play policy clock, and is a
separate decision from taking a dependency. Lint's `NewApi` keeps guarding every call site against
minSdk 29 regardless.

Bumping `compileSdk` means installing that exact platform everywhere the build runs. The minor is part
of the package name (`platforms;android-37.1` ≠ `platforms;android-37`), and three files name it
literally: `.gitlab-ci.yml`'s `ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK`, `qodana.yaml`'s bootstrap `sdkmanager` line, and the
F-Droid-image reproducibility job in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Build-tools is pinned next to it
(`buildToolsVersion = "37.0.0"` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, above AGP 9.4.1's 36.0.0 default — it decides
no packaged byte, it is pinned so every builder installs the package the build uses) and the same three
files carry that pin. Both packages must resolve in F-Droid's buildserver image before either moves;
`context/distribution.md` has the check.

The 37.1 → 37.0 revert (`6407e7d`, an F-Droid release blocker while their SDK log lacked 37.1) left every
one of those stale for a while; 37.1 came back on 2026-09-15 once the image resolved it. The catalog
notes, the two linter/CI pins and the READMEs are the places to re-grep after any bump.

## Why these choices

- **DI is Koin, not Hilt.** Hilt's Gradle plugin is broken on AGP 9.x in this window
  (dagger#5083 / #5099). Koin is pure-Kotlin runtime DI with no Gradle plugin / no annotation
  processor, so it can't be broken by AGP. Koin is started in `KnitApplication`; modules live in
  `app/src/main/java/app/getknit/knit/di/`.
- **Built-in Kotlin is overridden to 2.4.20, not AGP's bundled 2.2.10.** AGP 9.4.1 ships KGP 2.2.10,
  whose Kotlin-2.2 compiler cannot read class metadata produced by Kotlin 2.4 (this is what used to
  pin Coil to 3.3.0). The root `build.gradle.kts` puts KGP 2.4.20 on the buildscript classpath
  (`classpath(libs.kotlin.gradle.plugin)`) so built-in Kotlin compiles with 2.4.20 — a supported combo
  (Kotlin 2.4 requires AGP 9.1+ per Google's AGP/Kotlin matrix). **Bumping AGP does not move Kotlin**:
  the 9.4 line we now build on still bundles it (9.3 did too), so the override — not an AGP bump — is
  the lever. Keep KGP and the `ksp` version in lockstep with `kotlin`; KSP adopted independent (KSP2)
  versioning at 2.3.0 (decoupled, Kotlin 2.2+), so it no longer uses the old `<kotlin>-<ksp>` scheme.
- **The new DSL / Variant API is already on; AGP 10 changes nothing here.** `android.newDsl` has
  defaulted to *true* since AGP 9.0 — verified in the shipped 9.4.0 jar (`USE_NEW_DSL` → `iconst_1`,
  `FeatureStage.SoftlyEnforced(VERSION_10_0)`), because Google's DSL/API migration-timeline page reads as
  if 9.x still defaults to the legacy DSL and is wrong. Nothing in the build scripts touches the legacy
  variant API (`applicationVariants`, `variantFilter`, `registerJavaGeneratingTask`, Transform), and
  neither `android.newDsl` nor `android.newDsl.optOut` is set, so AGP 10 making the new API mandatory is a
  no-op for us. The `sourceSets { }` block in `app/build.gradle.kts` is AGP's own, not Kotlin's.
- **Do not re-add `android.disallowKotlinSourceSets=false`.** It sat in `gradle.properties` until
  2026-09-08 because AGP 9's built-in Kotlin rejects the `kotlin.sourceSets` DSL that KSP once used to
  register its generated sources. KSP2 (the 2.3.x line we run) goes through AGP's own sources API instead,
  so the flag buys nothing: `:app:assembleDebug` plus forced recompiles of `compileDebugKotlin` and
  `compileDebugUnitTestKotlin` all pass under `-Pandroid.disallowKotlinSourceSets=true`. AGP 9.4.0 carries
  the option at `FeatureStage.Experimental` with a `FutureStage` of `Enforced(VERSION_10_0)`, so `=false`
  stops being honored at AGP 10 anyway.
- **No explicit `kotlin-android` plugin.** AGP 9's built-in Kotlin handles compilation; only the
  `kotlin.plugin.compose`, `kotlin.plugin.serialization`, and `ksp` plugins are applied.
- Pin third-party versions in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (version catalog); probe Maven before
  bumping anything that could pull in a newer Kotlin stdlib.
- **Stable releases only**, with three standing exceptions: `detekt` 2.0.0-alpha.x, because the 1.23.x
  stable line cannot run on Gradle 9 at all, and `datastore` 1.3.0-alpha11, because no stable line carries
  the fix for a `data` collector that subscribes mid-write and never sees the write (b/431787506, work item
  #97: `watchProfileChanges` missed a rename made while the mesh started) — 1.2.1 is newer and still has it.
  It sat on alpha03, the first alpha with the fix, until that alpha's `libdatastore_shared_counter.so` put the
  app in 16 KB page-size compat mode (RELRO ends mid-page inside its writable segment; alphas 03-05 only, see
  `context/distribution.md`); alpha11 is the newest alpha with the old link layout. Move it to 1.3.0 when that
  goes stable, and to a later alpha only for a reason like that one. The third is the Compose Preview Screenshot
  Testing plugin (`com.android.compose.screenshot` + `screenshot-validation-api`, `composeScreenshot` in the
  catalog), which has never shipped a stable release: it is test-only (the `screenshotTest*` configurations —
  `releaseRuntimeClasspath` and the debug runtime are untouched) and the release APK is byte-identical with it
  applied (ADR 2026-10.gtmm). Take its newest alpha. So `cameraX` stays on 1.6.2 (1.7.0 is
  alpha), `lifecycle` on 2.11.0 (2.12.0 is alpha), `activity-compose` on 1.13.0
  (1.14.0 is alpha), `kotlinx-serialization` on 1.11.0 (1.12.0 is an RC), and AGP on 9.4.1 (9.5.0 is
  alpha). `navigation-compose` was held at 2.9.8 by this rule until 2.10.0 went stable, `robolectric`
  at 4.16.1 until 4.17 did, and `benchmark` at 1.5.0-rc02 until 1.5.0 did.

## Kotlin warnings are errors (`allWarningsAsErrors`)

`app/build.gradle.kts` sets `kotlin { compilerOptions { allWarningsAsErrors } }` for **every** compilation
in the module — main, unit-test and androidTest. Nothing else in the build sees these diagnostics: Android
Lint runs its own UAST issue registry, and detekt runs *without type resolution*, so an unused expression, an
always-true condition or a missing `@OptIn` is invisible to both. And kotlinc only prints a diagnostic for
the files it actually compiles, so an UP-TO-DATE / FROM-CACHE / incremental build reports nothing at all —
the module's full warning set only reappears on a cold compile of a variant nobody builds often, which is how
eighteen of them reached 2.5.0 unseen.

**`-Pknit.warningsAsErrors=false`** turns them back into warnings. That is the escape hatch for a toolchain
bump on this bleeding-edge stack — a new Kotlin, AGP or androidx release can deprecate an API we call and
turn a green build red. Flip it off, triage, fix, flip it back; don't delete the block. It changes no
bytecode, so release-APK bytes (and F-Droid's rebuild) are unaffected either way.

Two rules that follow from this, when a warning has no clean fix:

- **Suppress at the narrowest scope, with the reason.** `MainActivity.disableContentCapture()` exists only
  so `@Suppress("DEPRECATION")` covers one platform call instead of all of `onCreate`; `MeshtasticGatt`
  carries one on `connectAndConfigure` because every `connectGatt(Context, …)` overload is deprecated in
  compileSdk 37 in favour of an API-37-only replacement, eight releases above minSdk 29.
- **A no-op `when` branch is `-> {}`, never `-> { Unit }`.** The lone `Unit` inside a block is an unused
  expression; the braces themselves are required by ktlint whenever a sibling entry is braced.

## Static analysis: detekt / ktlint Gradle plugins

`detekt` runs via the **`dev.detekt` Gradle plugin** (detekt 2.0.x — the first line that supports
Gradle 9; 1.23.x capped at Gradle 8.12.1, and `dev.detekt` is the new plugin/group id). Applied on
`:app`, it analyzes `src/main/java` + `src/test/java` **without type resolution** (no compile classpath is
wired — same scope/behavior as the old CLI), overlaying `config/detekt/detekt.yml` on detekt's defaults
(`buildUponDefaultConfig = true`). The `detekt` task exits non-zero on findings; reports land in
`app/build/reports/detekt/`. CI's `verify:detekt` job runs `./gradlew detekt`. (Config note: detekt 2.0
renamed several config keys — `LongParameterList.constructorThreshold/functionThreshold` →
`allowedConstructorParameters/allowedFunctionParameters`, `TooManyFunctions.thresholdIn*` →
`allowedFunctionsPer*`, and the style rule `UnusedImports` → singular `UnusedImport`.)

`ktlint` runs via the **`org.jlleitschuh.gradle.ktlint` plugin**, applied on the root project (which
lints the `*.gradle.kts` scripts) and on `:app` (which lints the Kotlin sources). The ktlint *tool*
version is pinned to `libs.versions.ktlint` — independent of the plugin version (`ktlintPlugin`) — so rule
behavior stays fixed. Rules are the ktlint standard ruleset, configured via the repo-root **`.editorconfig`**
(auto-discovered), including the `@Composable` function-naming opt-out
(`ktlint_function_naming_ignore_when_annotated_with = Composable`). `./gradlew ktlintCheck` verifies (reports
in `build/reports/ktlint/`); **`./gradlew ktlintFormat` autocorrects** — a capability the old CLI lacked.
`detekt` and `ktlint` both run as `Stop` hooks (`.claude/hooks/gradle-{detekt,ktlint}-stop.sh`) alongside
`./gradlew lint`.

These are ordinary Gradle plugins now (this reverses the old "standalone CLIs" doctrine — ADR 007 is
Superseded by ADR 011). They still add nothing to `:app`'s compile/runtime classpath — detekt and ktlint
each run analysis in their own isolated task classpath — so the Kotlin-2.4-metadata hazard that motivated
the CLI approach doesn't apply (verified: `assembleDebug` + `lint` unaffected). Applying them locked new
tool configurations into `app/gradle.lockfile` — regenerate per the lockfile rule in
`rules/build-and-test.md` after any detekt/ktlint version bump.

## Coverage: Kover

`kover` (test coverage) runs as a Gradle plugin — coverage **must** instrument bytecode and hook the test
run, which only the plugin does cleanly (a CLI would have to swap offline-instrumented classes into AGP's
unit-test task). It's low-risk on this toolchain — unlike Hilt it does no compile-time
codegen; it hooks `testDebugUnitTest` *post-compile* and only adds Java-only agent/offline-runtime jars to
test-scope configs, so it never touches `:app`'s Kotlin-2.4 compile/runtime classpath (verified:
`assembleDebug` + `lint` unaffected). Note: **Kover 0.9.1 applied but silently failed to detect AGP 9.2.1's
build variants** (no per-variant tasks, empty report) — **0.9.8+** fixes it, so don't downgrade below it.
Coverage is measured from the debug unit tests (`koverHtmlReportDebug` / `koverXmlReportDebug` — the
per-*variant* tasks; the un-suffixed `koverHtmlReport` aggregates all variants). Only *generated* code is
excluded (Room `*_Impl`, Compose `ComposableSingletons`, `BuildConfig`) via `kover { reports { filters } }`
in `app/build.gradle.kts` — everything hand-written stays measured. **In Kover class globs `*` does NOT
cross the package `.` — use `**` to span packages** (a bare `*_Impl` matches nothing). CI runs it as the
advisory `test:coverage` job (mirrors `verify:detekt`), which archives the HTML/XML and scrapes the % from
`koverLogDebug`. Adding the plugin changed the lockfile (`kover-jvm-agent`) — regenerate per the lockfile
rule in `rules/build-and-test.md` after any Kover bump.

## Room 3 (`androidx.room3`) and its Gradle plugin

Room is **`androidx.room3:room3-*` 3.0.3**, not `androidx.room` — Room 3 is a new group and a new package,
not a version bump. Imports are `androidx.room3.*`; `androidx.sqlite.*` did **not** move. Consequences worth
knowing before you touch the data layer:

- **There is no `openHelperFactory`.** Room 3 deletes the SupportSQLite layer from the core API, so
  `setDriver(SQLiteDriver)` is the only seam for a custom engine. SQLCipher rides in as
  `SQLCipherDriver` (`net.zetetic:sqlcipher-android` 4.19.1; 4.18.0 was the release that added it) — see
  ADR 065.
  That is why Room 3 and SQLCipher move together; neither can be bumped past the other alone.
- **There is no `room3-ktx`.** `withWriteTransaction` / `useWriterConnection` / `immediateTransaction` are in
  `room3-runtime`. `androidx.room.withTransaction` is gone; `withWriteTransaction` is its replacement and is
  reentrant the same way (the connection rides in the coroutine context).
- **`Migration.migrate` and the `MigrationTestHelper` methods are `suspend`.** Migrations declare
  `override suspend fun migrate(connection: SQLiteConnection)`, and every `KnitDatabaseMigrationTest` case
  runs inside `runTest { }`.
- Room 3 does **not** force the KMP builder form: `Room.databaseBuilder(context, Klass::class.java, name)`
  and `inMemoryDatabaseBuilder(context, Klass::class.java)` still exist, and the Android builder defaults to
  `AndroidSQLiteDriver` when no driver is set — which is what the Robolectric DAO tests rely on.

The schema JSON is exported by the **`androidx.room3` Gradle plugin**, whose extension is `room3 { }` (not
`room { }`): `room3 { schemaDirectory("$projectDir/schemas") }` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, not the raw
`ksp { arg("room.schemaLocation", …) }` — the plugin *rejects* an explicit `room.schemaLocation` arg, so
don't add one back. It requires `exportSchema = true` on `KnitDatabase`. With only build types (no product
flavors) it writes to the flat `app/schemas/<db-class>/<version>.json`, so the debug-asset wiring and
`KnitDatabaseMigrationTest` are unchanged.

**Gotcha:** KSP incremental caching can skip re-export when the committed schema is unchanged
(`copyRoomSchemas` shows `NO-SOURCE`); to force a fresh export after a `@Database` bump, clear
`app/schemas/` and rebuild — then **`git checkout -- app/schemas/` to bring back versions 1..N-1**, which
Room does not regenerate. Only the *current* version is ever exported; the older files are history the
migration tests read, and clearing the directory deletes them.

## The debug APK packages two ABIs, not four

`buildTypes.debug` sets `ndk { abiFilters }` to **`arm64-v8a` + `x86_64`** (`val debugAbis` above the
`android` block). Debug is unminified and carries both tflite models, so it starts around 150 MB; the
default four-ABI packaging adds ~28 MB of `lib/`, and the two 32-bit slices are dead weight — every lab
Pixel is `arm64-v8a` and every Gradle-managed emulator image is `x86_64`, so nothing we build for runs
`x86` or `armeabi-v7a`. Measured: 150 MB → 138 MB, and `-Pknit.debugAbis=arm64-v8a` → 130 MB for a
device-only reflash. `-Pknit.debugAbis=` (empty) restores unfiltered four-ABI packaging.

Two things not to get wrong:

- **Never drop `x86_64`.** `pixel7api33`/`pixel8api34` are x86_64 system images and SQLCipher loads through
  `System.loadLibrary` at DB open, so an x86_64-less debug APK fails every instrumented test at the first
  Room access — not at build time. (Keeping `arm64-v8a` matters too: AGP warns that the managed-device
  image ABI default flips from `x86_64` to `arm64-v8a` in **AGP 10.0**, and this APK already carries both.)
- **Never lift it to `defaultConfig`.** `abiFilters` is a packaging filter and needs no NDK installed
  (unlike `ndk { debugSymbolLevel }`, see `context/distribution.md`), but release-APK bytes are
  byte-compared by F-Droid — release and staging keep all four ABIs. Verified after the change: a plain
  `assembleRelease` still packages `x86`, `x86_64`, `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`.

Why it is worth caring about at all: the lab devices are on network adb, and throughput varies ~80× with
the band a phone happens to be associated to (~0.5 MB/s on 2.4 GHz vs ~40 MB/s on 5 GHz). Trimming the APK
helps at the margin; **a slow `installDebug` is usually the phone sitting on 2.4 GHz**, which is the thing
to check first — `adb -s <dev> shell cmd wifi status` reports the frequency. Never toggle Wi-Fi over adb
on a network-adb device (`rules/devices.md`).
