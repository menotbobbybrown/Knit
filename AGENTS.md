# AGENTS.md — Knit

Router for coding agents. Knit is an offline Android **mesh messenger** (Kotlin/Compose) that runs
**Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) + Bluetooth LE** simultaneously behind one `MeshTransport` seam
(`CompositeMeshTransport`), no Google Nearby / GMS. This file *points* to context — load a `.agents/`
file only when its trigger matches. Full design detail lives in `docs/`.

## Identity

You are a senior Android/Kotlin engineer on a deliberately bleeding-edge toolchain (AGP 9.3.0 /
Kotlin 2.4.0, Koin DI). Favor correctness, wire/convergence safety, and matching the surrounding style
over cleverness. Start with `.agents/context/architecture.md` for the subsystem map and data flow.

## Context routing

- **Before any build / dependency / tooling change:** READ `.agents/context/toolchain.md` — the
  bleeding-edge choices (Koin-not-Hilt, the Kotlin-2.4 override, detekt/ktlint/Kover/Room as Gradle
  plugins) are deliberate; don't "fix" them.
- **Before changing any dependency version** (catalog, wrapper, plugin, lockfile, a CI action or image):
  run the `upgrade-notes` skill (`.agents/skills/upgrade-notes/SKILL.md`). It reads each vendor's breaking,
  migration and security notes for the exact interval through the `whatsnew` MCP server in `.mcp.json`.
- **Before / after running Gradle:** obey `.agents/rules/build-and-test.md` (which task when, JDK 21,
  lockfile regen). Command list: `.agents/context/commands.md`.
- **Before touching `app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`, the `:baselineprofile` module, or the
  `nonMinifiedRelease` build type:** READ `.agents/context/baseline-profile.md` — the generator is quarantined
  behind `-Pknit.baselineProfile=true` on purpose, so that the release build consumes a committed text file
  and stays byte-reproducible for F-Droid. Don't wire the plugin into `:app`.
- **Before touching release signing, `packaging`/`ndk` config, `.gitattributes`, or anything else that
  changes release-APK bytes:** READ `.agents/context/distribution.md` — Play and F-Droid ship different
  artifacts under different keys, and F-Droid byte-compares its own rebuild against ours, so the release
  build must not depend on the build machine (no NDK on the APK path, no foojay JDK download, no Git LFS on the
  release path — the screenshot references are its one test-only LFS rule).
- **When editing any Kotlin/Compose/data code:** obey `.agents/rules/coding.md`.
- **When adding to `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## Unreleased`, or writing a fastlane changelog:** obey
  `.agents/rules/changelog.md` — two sentences, about forty words, run through the `humanizer` skill.
  A `PreToolUse` hook blocks the edit otherwise. Shipped sections are a record; never restyle them.
- **When touching `mesh/`, `protocol/`, or `data/`:** obey `.agents/rules/mesh.md`, then READ the
  relevant reference — `.agents/context/mesh-transport.md` (radios / NAN / BLE),
  `.agents/context/wire-format.md` (CBOR wire), `.agents/context/store-and-forward.md` (custody /
  convergence), `.agents/context/e2e-encryption.md` (crypto). If a change can only be made by *breaking*
  the wire, don't — park it in `docs/NEXT_WIRE_BREAK.md` (the staging list, so a future break carries them
  all at once) and find the additive route per `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.
- **When touching `vectors/`, `GoldenVectorTest`, `KeyedVectorTest` or `IosEmittedVectorTest`, or when a
  change moves a wire byte:** READ `vectors/README.md` and ADR 2026-09.fzh7. The iOS port tests against the
  same files; regenerate with `KNIT_WRITE_VECTORS=1`, never by hand, and never edit `ios-emitted-v1.json`.
- **When filing or rewriting a GitLab issue:** obey `.agents/rules/issues.md` — one template
  (`.gitlab/issue_templates/Agent.md`), one title shape, fixed headings, existing labels only.
- **When your first prompt opens with "# Paired change", or a message arrives from the `knit-pair` supervisor
  or a `knit-ios-*` worker:** obey `.agents/rules/paired-change.md`. The iOS half runs in its own session
  under knit-ios's rules; never edit that repo.
- **When touching `mesh/bluetooth/BleSideChannel`, `SideCarousel`, `SideScanPolicy`, `SideCapableTracker`,
  `BleFastRoutePolicy`, `BleAdvertPayload`'s flags byte, or `BluetoothMeshTransport.fastFanout`/`fastSend`:**
  READ ADR 2026-09.sjaa and the "page carousel" section of `.agents/context/mesh-transport.md`. The BLE side
  channel carries `shouldFastFanout` frames on non-connectable extended-advertising pages — one
  `FastFrameCodec` unit per 236-B page, never a chain, never presence, never a DM-form frame — gated per
  peer on the advert's flags byte and dark in release behind `BuildConfig.BLE_SIDE_PLANE` until its device
  trial (CHECK `.agents/memory/roadmap.md`). The receive scan is Off for an all-linked clique with nothing
  streaming (ADR 2026-09.u8qj) — the link copy already reaches every linked peer; don't widen that gate. `hasFastPlane` is now true for Bluetooth: the link copy the
  composite used to send lives inside the transport's `fastFanout`/`fastSend`; don't add it back upstream.
- **When touching `CodedPhyPolicy`, `PhyStepper`, `BlePhyControl`, `CodedPhyDiag`, `CodedAdvertPace`,
  `BleAdvertiser.codedParams` / `setInterval`, `BleScanner.phys`, `BlePresenceTracker`'s per-PHY RSSI,
  `BuildConfig.BLE_CODED_PHY` or `…debug.PHY`:** READ ADR
  2026-10.yvn6 and the Coded PHY section of `.agents/context/mesh-transport.md`. An experiment, dark in release: a
  second presence set on Coded (the legacy advert stays), an all-PHY scan, a Coded sighting scored on the 1M scale
  (+12 dB) so every −90 floor is untouched, and per-link 1M ↔ Coded S=8 steps driven by the larger id through a GATT
  handle on the link's ACL. Capability is inferred from hearing the Coded advert — no flags-byte bit. A dialer heard on
  Coded alone is admitted as unsighted (shzv's tie-break holds for 1M), and OFF leaves a link on its PHY. A Coded dial
  gets a 25 s watchdog, and a link that drops at range makes the dialed side's Coded advert fast for 3 min, its
  interval moved in place (`CodedAdvertPace`, `BleAdvertiser.setInterval`; the amendment of 2026-10-02). CHECK
  `.agents/memory/roadmap.md` for what the release flag waits on.
- **When touching `mesh/lora/` or `mesh/bluetooth/meshtastic/` (the LoRa/Meshtastic bridge):** READ
  `.agents/context/lora-bridge.md` — a Meshtastic board over BLE GATT extends the **Nearby room and 1:1
  DMs** over LoRa as a fast-plane-only `MeshTransport` child, shipped visible since 2.5.0 behind
  `BuildConfig.LORA_PLANE` and off until the user pairs a board (ADR 038 + 039, introduced by ADR
  2026-09.6gtm — it is no longer a gate that keeps anything out of shipped builds). `mesh/lora/` is
  pure/JVM-tested; the only `android.bluetooth.*` importer is `mesh/bluetooth/meshtastic/MeshtasticGatt`.
  **Before touching `noteReachable`, `airedByPocket` / `boardOwners` / `heardVia`, `fastSend`'s `targetedKey`, or
  `AckSync.backOff`:** READ ADR 2026-09.6gk8 — a co-pocket board's airing is not LoRa reach (but a far
  gateway's still is, ADR 2026-09.wkbk), and a cleartext owed tick backs off like the sealed one.
  **Before touching `DmAutoReplyPolicy`, `Destination.Reply`, `OutboundFrame.to`, or `MeshtasticLink.send`'s
  `to`:** READ ADR 2026-09.4n5p — a Meshtastic DM to a set-up board is answered once with a fixed unicast
  (once per sender per day, once per 30 s for anybody, the room's air share, never from a stock or a
  dedicated-slot board), and that reply is the only unicast the plane sends.
  **Before touching `MeshtasticSession.connectLoop`, `BoardDialPolicy`, `MeshtasticGatt.dial`'s modes, or what the
  pacer does while the link is down:** READ ADR 2026-09.hp88 — three direct dials, then the controller's
  `autoConnect` with an hourly direct net and no arbiter while waiting; a refusal backs off, only a spent window
  doesn't; the pacer parks on `link.state`, never its 1 s tick.
- **When touching `BluetoothMeshTransport.superviseAccepted`, `BleAdmissionPolicy`, `teardownLink`, `LinkEvents`,
  `neverSighted`, `LonelyDialPolicy` / `noLinkSince`, or what a held link scores for eviction:** READ ADR
  2026-09.shzv and ADR 2026-09.hj4a. A dialer presence holds is judged by the old tie-break, unchanged — the
  Android mesh must not move. Only an unsighted dialer (an iPhone
  advertises no service data, so it is never sighted and never dialed) is admitted whatever the id order, and its
  second link replaces the first only once the held one is 30 s old. A teardown passes the link it means
  (`only =`) — never re-key it by node id alone — and only a never-sighted link scores the −90 floor. The one
  exception to "larger dials" is hj4a's lonely dial: after 180 s with **no** link (`noLinkSince`, the clock the
  scan's lonely cadence shares) a node dials the strongest larger id it sights, one at a time, and it rests on the unsighted admit:
  a responder that sighted the newcomer refuses it and dials it itself. Its oracle, `bt lonely dial <id> (…)`, is
  keyed by the iOS interop harness — don't reword it.
- **When touching a TX power in `BleAdvertiser` (`presenceParams` / `sideParams` / `codedParams`), an RSSI threshold
  on an advert reading, `PromotionPolicy.msUntilDue`, `nextConnectWaitMs`, `mesh/power/ElapsedWait`, or any wait in
  `BluetoothMeshTransport`'s scan loop, connect loop or dial/HELLO watchdogs:** READ ADR 2026-10.ryak and ADR
  2026-10.pj9w, and the "Discovery keeps wall time" section of `.agents/context/mesh-transport.md`. The presence
  advert is `TX_POWER_HIGH` and every discovery set goes out at its power (pinned by `BleAdvertiserTest`); every −90
  floor reads it, so a new advert threshold is sized against HIGH. A dial gated on the clock gets a wake when it comes
  due — the next sighting is not one on a screen-off phone. The waits a relink waits on (connect loop, dial/HELLO
  watchdogs, scan window and pause, the hunting gap) go through `elapsedWait`, never `delay` / `withTimeoutOrNull`,
  which stop while the CPU sleeps; the settled, linked and relaxed scan gaps keep stretching on purpose (power
  budgets — moving one is a battery change). Measure with `scripts/ble-link-trial.py`.
- **When touching `BleAdvertiser.reassert` / `onAdvertisingEnabled`, `AdvertReassertPolicy`, or the transport's
  `advertLoop` / ACL edge receiver:** READ ADR 2026-10.9utz. The stack re-enables its advertising sets around every
  connection and the controller can refuse that (0x0d), reporting it only for a connection *to* the set — never for
  one the phone made — and never retrying. So the transport enables the live presence set again itself: 2.5 s after
  each ACL edge, on a doubling wait after a reported refusal, on a 10 s (no link) / 60 s net, and at once on `heal()`.
  A stopped set must stay down (`stop()` clears what `reassert` would restart). The ACL receiver is
  `RECEIVER_EXPORTED` on purpose: the Bluetooth app (uid 1002), not `system_server`, sends `ACTION_ACL_*`, so a
  non-exported receiver never fires (the ADR's amendment). Tests: `AdvertReassertPolicyTest`, `BleAdvertiserTest`.
- **When touching `mesh/bluetooth/BleDoorbell`, `DoorbellPolicy`, `Protocol.CAP_DOORBELL`, or what
  `BluetoothMeshTransport.writeOnce` rings:** READ ADR 2026-09.dqvb (companion change A4 for the iOS port). A link
  rings only when the peer's HELLO carries `CAP_DOORBELL`, which Android never claims, so Android↔Android links never
  touch GATT. The doorbell UUIDs are cross-platform law, and the schedule is the port's. `typing`, `blobreq` and
  `keyreq` don't ring. The GATT client attaches to the link's own ACL, closes on a 2 s attach timeout, and lives
  and dies with the link. A ring is a write without response, poked at the enqueue, never after the socket write.
  The lookup runs at link-up and each one that finds the doorbell asks for `CONNECTION_PRIORITY_BALANCED`: an
  iPhone central runs the link at a 720 ms supervision timeout, BALANCED carries 5 s (#102, the ADR's amendment).
  The stack's put-back of the central's own timeout can land after that ask, so `DoorbellPolicy.Balanced` asks again,
  on the hidden `onConnectionUpdated` or a 2 s settle check, at most twice a lookup (the put-back amendment).
- **When touching `mesh/bluetooth/GattPayloads`, `BleGattPayloadReader`, `BleAdvertPayload.FLAG_DIALS_GATT_PEERS`,
  `BuildConfig.BLE_GATT_PEERS`, `BleScanner`'s UUID filter, or `BluetoothMeshTransport.onScanResult` / `sight`:**
  READ ADR 2026-09.kwq2 (companion change A3; knit-ios ADR 2026-09.xzpt) and its section in
  `.agents/context/mesh-transport.md`. A foreground iPhone is found by reading its GATT payload and dialed by the
  unchanged rule (larger id dials); `GattPayloads` is the iOS pacing line for line (one read at a time, 12 s,
  30 s / 10 min waits) plus a 64-address LRU, and a payload lives until one of the contract's three rules forgets it: a
  dial failing before its channel opens (never on HANDSHAKE), a HELLO on a link to the address naming another node,
  or 60 s of scanning unheard with no link up. The flag is set only while the reader runs — one build switch gates filter, reader and flag, dark in
  release until the trial. A1 (shzv) stays whole: it is the fallback that makes a clear flag safe.
- **When touching `linkpreview/`, `net/`, `mesh/protocol/LinkPreviewBlob`, or anything that opens an
  Internet socket outside the spool plane:** READ ADR 2026-09.n752 (and 2026-09.7x8k: a send holds up to 5 s
  for the card its link is fetching, or the share sheet never carries one; a LoRa thread takes a card exactly
  as it takes a photo — no `loraCarry` gate on the fetch). A link preview is a card the
  **sender** fetches and sends as an ordinary attachment under its own MIME (no wire field, no DB change); the receiver
  never fetches, both ends screen the card's picture and text into one verdict, and the fetch is gated on
  `net/InternetGate` (a validated route, never the NAN link), bound to that `Network`, https-only, with a
  private-address DNS guard. `okhttp3` stays confined to the two files `rules/mesh.md` names.
- **When touching `transfer/`, `MeshTransport.pause`/`resume`, or anything that hands the Wi-Fi radio to a
  second role:** READ `.agents/context/direct-transfer.md` — a large file goes to one nearby contact over a
  Wi-Fi Direct group the two phones raise, never over the mesh and never custodied (ADR 2026-09.wtmz, the
  seal 2026-09.37ce, the surfaces 2026-09.7uqe). `TransferManager`/`TransferStream` are pure behind the
  `DirectWifi`/`TransferFiles`/`TransferSignals` seams, and `AndroidDirectWifi` is the one
  `android.net.wifi.p2p` importer. Wi-Fi Aware does **not** yield to our own P2P on Android 12+, so it must
  be paused explicitly — that is what `pause`/`resume` are for.
- **When touching `location/`, the chat overflow's "Send location" item, or anything that reads the device's
  position:** READ ADR 2026-09.tss4. A shared position is a `geo:` line in the message body (no wire field,
  no capability bit); it is read only between the pin tap and the send, by `ChatViewModel.startLocation`,
  the one collector of `LocationSource.fixes`, and `location/AndroidLocationSource` is the one
  `android.location` importer (detekt-enforced). Never ask for the grant at onboarding.
- **When touching `mesh/MeshService` (`onCreate` / `onStartCommand` / `postForeground`), `MeshService.start`,
  `canReclaimForegroundService`, or the `KnitApp` effects that start the mesh:** READ ADR 043 (a refused claim
  makes a stillbirth; the caller-side guard and the resume retry) and ADR 2026-09.f69x (every non-Stop start
  re-claims the foreground state — the system demotes a background-restricted app's service silently, and a
  `startForegroundService` into that instance arms a deadline nothing else would meet) and ADR 2026-09.vztn
  (`onCreate` claims the state before anything, then resolves the graph on the **app scope**, never on the main
  thread — `onCreate` + the `onStartCommand` behind it share a separate 20 s "executing service" ANR budget, and a
  process born for the service is the one the UI never pre-built the graph for; every later callback keys on
  `meshStarted`, never on an injected field; a build failure is a crash on the main looper, except a
  `KeystoreUnavailableException` down its cause chain, which stands the service down with an alert — ADR
  2026-10.47rw). The foreground deadline is 30 s on Android 15 (10 s before), and
  `getForegroundServiceType()` cannot tell you it was lost. `BootReceiver` starts through
  `MeshService.startFromBoot`, never `start` — ADR 2026-09.29dw: the pre-check reads process state, a
  receiver's is `IMPORTANCE_SERVICE`, and the boot exemption is the platform's. Regression:
  `MeshServiceForegroundReclaimTest`, `MeshServiceGraphOffMainTest`, `GraphlessProcessTest`,
  `MeshServiceStartTest`, `BootReceiverTest`.
  **When touching the notification's Pause / Resume actions, `SettingsStore.meshPausedUntil`, `mesh/MeshPause`,
  `MeshService.applyPause`, or the resume alarms:** READ ADR 2026-09.wz99. A pause is one DataStore deadline
  the service applies idempotently in place — the service stays foreground, `MeshManager` goes down, every
  surface reads the key through `MeshPause.activeDeadline` — never `MeshTransport.pause` (that is the Wi-Fi
  Direct hand-over) and never a stop-and-restart (an alarm cannot start a foreground service from the
  background). Every plain start re-claims without resuming; the two resume alarms are inexact and bounded, not
  `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`; Stop cancels the store collector before `stopSelf()`. **Stop is sticky** (the
  amendment): `KnitApp`'s route effect and `ON_RESUME` observer both ask `ui/MeshStartPolicy.kt`'s
  `shouldStartMeshFromUi` with `SettingsStore.meshEnabled` read from the store at that moment (a
  lifecycle-collected copy is stale on the resume after a Stop — device-observed) — and the chat list's Start
  only writes the flag back; don't add a second starter or decide on a cached value.
  Regression: `MeshServicePauseTest`, `MeshStartPolicyTest`.
  **Before touching the type bitmask `postForeground` claims (`meshForegroundServiceTypes`), the manifest's
  `<service>`, or `TransportHealth.ForegroundOnly` / `NanSessionFault` in `mesh/wifiaware/`:** READ ADR
  2026-09.535d. The service claims `location` on exactly the tiers where `requiredRadioPermissions` rides the
  location grant (29-32) — the Wi-Fi Aware publish/subscribe are gated on the foreground-only location app-op
  there, and only the *runtime* type bit lifts it (the manifest is a bound, never a grant; `0` silently drops
  it). The manifest's `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` lint is suppressed on purpose (Play's declaration form). A
  location refusal off screen is held as `ForegroundOnly` and retried on `heal()`, never torn down through
  `onSessionDead`.
- **When touching `MeshManager.heal` (the basket, `healBasket`, `HealFloors`, `sweepKeyRetention`,
  `replayUndeliveredGroupCustody`), `MeshService.onSignificantMotion` / `MOTION_HEAL_FLOOR_MS`, or
  `ForwardStore.liveGroupChatFrames`:** READ ADR 2026-09.6st4. The radio poke (`transport.heal()`) runs on every call —
  a resume is what lifts the NAN location app-op (535d) and buys the lonely loop its re-arm (kb68) — so never floor
  `heal()` whole; the motion trigger is floored at its source (60 s), one basket runs at a time, and the retention
  sweeps and the custody replay run once an hour off the start's stamp. The replay reads the store's group-chat query,
  never `liveFrames`. Regression: `MeshServiceMotionTest`, `MeshManagerTest`'s heal cases, `ForwardDaoTest`.
- **When touching `mesh/power/PowerPolicy` (`idleAfterScan` / `lonelyRelaxed` / the `LONELY_*` constants),
  `mesh/wifiaware/NanLonelyPolicy`, or the cadence in `BluetoothMeshTransport.scanLoop`:** READ ADR
  2026-09.kb68 and ADR 2026-09.w3xk. The shared rule is "alone ≥ 3 min, not charging"; each radio picks its
  relaxed cadence — the BLE scan opens a screen-on node's gap to 60 s (12 s BALANCED window kept), the NAN
  re-arm keeps a screen-on node aggressive on purpose (a 30 s tick leaves ICM lit) — so don't flip one radio's
  interactive case without the other's device trial. Charging never relaxes. Tests: `PowerPolicyTest`,
  `NanLonelyPolicyTest`.
- **When touching the responder's `onUnavailable`, `refileResponder`, `NanResponderPolicy`, or what refunds
  `responderRefusals` / `responderCycles` in `WifiAwareTransport`:** READ ADR 2026-09.bgk3. A verdict with a
  link, handshake or accept of ours live is the documented knock refusal — re-filed after the floor, never
  counted; a verdict with the interface free is about the request — counted, backed off, and at five in a row
  given up for a session cycle, three per episode, refunded only by the responder's `onAvailable` (never a
  fresh session or the availability edge: the cycle produces both). The tests are in `NanResponderPolicyTest`.
- **When touching `NanInitiatorPolicy`, the `TRANSPORT_WIFI` watch in `WifiAwareTransport` (`onStaLost` /
  `onStaAvailable`), `initiatorHeld` / `releaseInitiatorHold`, `NanInitiatorJournal`, or what `digestSyncWanted`
  / `bulkSyncWanted` gate on:** READ ADR 2026-09.m8kc. A Wi-Fi blip (lost → available in 15 s) within two minutes
  *after* an unlinked initiate of ours is a strike; three hold the initiator role — the responder, discovery,
  cues and the fast plane keep running — refunded only by an initiator link, the user's Try again, or the
  build+ROM stamp, never by `stop`, `heal`, a session cycle or the Aware edge; one probe initiate a day on the
  wall clock. The hold lives in those two gates so the wedge watchdog never counts a held peer as owed (Tier-2 is
  a process kill and the hold is journaled): never read `reconcileWanted` / `bulkWanted.isWanted` around them.
  Not a `NanConnectPolicy` streak. Tests: `NanInitiatorPolicyTest`.
- **When touching `NanMessagePlanePolicy`, `checkMessagePlane`, `sendCoord` / `msgInFlight`, the
  `onMessageSendSucceeded` / `onMessageSendFailed` callbacks, or `…debug.NANMSG`:** READ ADR 2026-09.jjhg. The
  coordination plane (cues + fast path) freezes after a burst while discovery keeps working — a blocked framework
  send queue, or a firmware that fails every follow-up — and the one cure is a NAN restart, which our session
  cycle is because Knit is the sole Aware client. The watchdog reads acks, not health: a send unanswered for a
  watchdog tick with no ack since, or two heartbeats of failures with zero acks *and a fresh sighting*, cycles the
  session under Tier 1's budget (shared `lastReattachAt`, 3 per episode, never with a live link); the episode ends
  only on an ack after it began — never on the cycle or on its own NAN-down beat (that refund is the 9dnk
  livelock). A send on a closed session gets no callback ever, so it is never recorded as in flight. Tests:
  `NanMessagePlanePolicyTest`; on hardware the soak's `nan-outbound-dead` rule.
- **When touching `moderation/MlTextModerator`, `NsfwImageModerator`, `ModelLease`, `TfLiteModels`,
  `ModelLoadGuard`, the `…debug.MODEL` bridge, or `noCompress` in `app/build.gradle.kts`:** READ ADR 037 and
  ADR 2026-09.cq9z. Each interpreter is mmapped from the APK's **Stored** `.tflite` entry (`noCompress "tflite"`
  is load-bearing; no `tensorflow-lite-support`), built with explicit options (2 threads, XNNPACK), and held
  on a `ModelLease`: the lease owns the mutex, the ten-minute idle reaper and the attempted/resident split — a
  load that returned nothing is spent for the process (that is how the poison-pill survives an unload), a
  reload goes through `ModelLoadGuard` again, and `Interpreter.close()` is never called outside the lease.
  Never put `NsfwImageModerator` on a warm-up path. Regression: `ModelLeaseTest`, `ModelLoadGuardTest`,
  `MlTextModeratorWarmUpTest`; on hardware `ToxicityInstrumentedTest` / `NsfwInstrumentedTest`.
- **When touching `legal/`, `ui/about/`, `app/src/main/assets/legal/`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, or a shipped
  dependency:** READ ADR 2026-09.6eb6. The in-app Open-source licenses list is `legal/ThirdPartyNotices.kt`,
  pinned to the notices table by `ThirdPartyNoticesSyncTest` and to `app/gradle.lockfile`'s
  `releaseRuntimeClasspath` by `ReleaseClasspathNoticesTest` — a new shipped dependency is a row in both files
  (with the artifact prefixes that claim it) or a `NOT_SHIPPED` entry with its reason, and nothing else makes
  those tests pass. The license texts are committed copies (no Gradle task; `assets/legal/COPYING` is
  byte-pinned to root `COPYING`), and nothing from the build machine — git SHA, timestamp — goes into a
  release's About: the release APK is byte-reproduced by F-Droid, so only the debug variant fills
  `BuildConfig.GIT_SHA`. No license plugin; `legal/InstallSource.kt` is the app's one installer read.
- **When touching `ui/onboarding/`, `ui/Permissions.kt`, `ui/BackgroundBattery.kt`, or `BootReceiver`'s start
  decision:** READ ADR 2026-09.nzpr. Entry is gated on `hasRadioPermissions` alone — the transports assume
  those grants (`@SuppressLint("MissingPermission")` is a lint suppression, not a runtime guard), so the mesh
  never starts without them. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` and the battery exemption are optional rows on the
  permissions page (`MessageNotifier` self-checks before posting), and `SettingsStore.onboardingSeen` only
  picks which page a returning phone opens on, never whether onboarding shows. The name page writes through
  the shared `ui/components/DisplayNameField`; a grant added to `requiredRadioPermissions` re-wedges the
  front door.
  The battery row (here and in Settings) reads `ui/BackgroundBattery.kt`'s three-position enum, not the bare
  exemption — READ ADR 2026-09.gc3m before touching it: Restricted wins over a stale exemption, and no prompt
  of ours can lift it, so that state always lands on "Open settings".
  The unused-app row beside it reads `ui/UnusedAppPause.kt` (`isAutoRevokeWhitelisted`, API 30+, null below
  so the row hides) — READ ADR 2026-09.54xg: it has no prompt, its default is not an error (`quietHint`), and
  its callback is `openUnusedAppPauseSettings`, not `openSettings`, because Android 11 keeps the switch on a
  page of its own.
- **When touching `ui/DeviceSupervision.kt`, `ui/components/PermissionDeniedDialog`, the `settingsHint` of a
  permission row, or the location / mic / camera gates' denial copy:** READ ADR 2026-09.a8ud. A parent's or
  an administrator's denial (`POLICY_FIXED`) is indistinguishable from "don't ask again" from inside the
  app, so the only signal is *who administers the phone* — Family Link by its pinned profile-owner package,
  else any management signal — and every hint is conditional ("if Settings greys it out as Disabled by
  admin", the platform's own wording). Family Link
  can hold only the classic groups (never Nearby devices), so `supervisedHint` names a parent on the radio
  row only where Location is in it; a managed phone is named everywhere. Family Link's pauses and downtime
  leave the running foreground service alone (device-verified 2026-09-16) — don't add restart machinery
  for them; `android.app.admin.*` / `UserManager` stay confined to that one file (detekt).
- **When touching `data/crypto/DatabaseKey`, `SqlCipherKey`, the driver or pool size in `KnitDatabase.build`, or
  anything else that opens a SQLCipher file:** READ ADR 2026-09.uzkm. The database is keyed with the passphrase's
  raw form (`x'<hex>'`, no KDF), and a file an older build keyed through the KDF is rekeyed once by
  `SqlCipherKey.upgrade` before Room opens it. Never hand SQLCipher the bare passphrase: every pooled connection
  would pay a 256,000-iteration derivation under the pool's lock (≈46 s of cold start on a 32-bit phone). The pool
  is capped at four. Regression: `SqlCipherKeyTest`, `SqlCipherRawKeyTest`.
- **When touching `data/crypto/KeystoreSecret`, `KeystoreCipher`, `KeystoreFailure`, `DatabaseKey.getOrCreate` /
  `current`, `IdentityKeyStore.loaded` / `generateAndStore`, the `.lost` slot, `ui/StorageGate`, the `StorageGate`
  half of `MainActivity`, or anything else that reads a Keystore-wrapped secret:** READ ADR 2026-10.47rw. Only
  proof a secret is gone may wipe or mint: a tag that fails, a key permanently invalidated, a key missing on
  every look, a wrap too short to be one — the same verdict on all three attempts. Everything else, unrecognised
  included, is a refusal: `KeystoreUnavailableException`, every file as it was, and the service and the UI stand
  down on it (alert / Try again) instead of crashing. The screen's Start over is the user's choice behind a
  confirmation (`SignOut.here`'s wipe); never trigger it from code or a retry count. Look keys up with `getKey`, never `getEntry` (keystore2
  answers null for a busy backend there); never generate under an alias a live wrap depends on without
  confirmed absence; read a mint back before using it; and a live reader (the backup writer) uses `current()` /
  `read()`, never `getOrCreate()`. Debug builds refuse on cue while `files/keystore-fault` holds a count.
  Regression: `KeystoreSecretTest`, `DatabaseKeyRecoveryTest`, `IdentityKeyStoreRecoveryTest`,
  `BackupWriterKeystoreTest`, `StorageGateTest`; on a device `DatabaseKeyTest`.
- **When touching `data/draft/`, what the composer keeps between visits, or the chat list's `Draft: …`
  preview:** READ ADR 2026-09.qtg9. An unsent draft is a row in the encrypted DB (never the DataStore —
  it is message text), written debounced on the *application* scope, and handed to the composer exactly
  once by `consumeRestoredDraft()`; nothing is persisted before that hand-over, because the field reports
  itself empty the moment it composes. The list shows it in place of the preview only while
  `updatedAt` beats the newest message, and never touches the row's time or sort. Text only: the staged
  attachment, the reply quote and the mention bindings stay draft-local to the screen.
- **When touching `saved_files` / `data/blob/SavedFileEntity`, `ChatViewModel.openAttachment` /
  `saveAttachmentTo`, or what a file bubble's tap does:** READ ADR 2026-09.7ad3. A received file opens from the
  copy the user saved it to (a persisted read grant on the picker's document, recorded by blob hash) and never
  from the blob store (ADR 029); a copy that is gone is forgotten and the picker comes back. A risky file is
  only ever saved. The table is device-local — never in a backup — and goes with its blob in the GC.
- **When touching `data/search/`, `messages_fts` / `MessageFtsEntity`, `ui/search/`, the chat route's
  `messageId` argument, or the shared list rules in `ui/ConversationTitles.kt` / `ui/contacts/ContactUniverse.kt`:**
  READ ADR 2026-09.wdfz (the FTS4 index: one bounded `MATCH` read, the `term*` builder, the rowid and
  no-VACUUM invariants) and ADR 2026-09.wnh6 (one screen over the chat list's own universe — its
  membership, titles, speaker and contacts rules live in those two shared files so search cannot drift
  from the list; a hit opens the thread through `chat/{id}?messageId=` and the quote-jump machinery,
  never a second thread view). "Search in this chat" is deferred — CHECK `.agents/memory/roadmap.md`.
- **When touching `wearstatus/`, `mesh/wear/`, `mesh/bluetooth/wear/WearStatusServer`, the `:wear` module, or
  `BuildConfig.WEAR_STATUS`:** READ ADR 2026-09.wetm. A bonded Wear OS watch reads the mesh status the phone serves
  while `MeshService` runs — no Data Layer (GMS), never on the mesh wire — over a secure RFCOMM socket on the Classic
  link first (one `WearStatusFrame`; its third amendment: the phone's eight GATT slots fill with mesh links, so an LE
  read can be refused outright), then one read-only encrypted GATT characteristic over LE as the fallback, reachable
  through the mesh's own advert and, only while paused, the server's own. Keep both until other watches report. A prototype: dark in release, `:wear` only under `-Pknit.wear=true`. The watch surfaces (complications in every suited type with a staleness timeline, a
  Material3 tile that never blocks on Bluetooth, the M3 Expressive app) are the ADR's 2026-09-27 amendment; Wear Widgets wait for a stable release.
  The second amendment extends the snapshot to exactly 20 bytes (carrying, far peers, 4-bit per-peer plane masks — no ids; `GOLDEN_EXTENDED`
  in both modules) for the peer map, and adds the watch-only day history (`StatusHistory`/`DayStats`). `wearstatus/` is
  compiled into both modules, so it imports nothing but `java.*`/`kotlin.*`, and its layout is pinned by one golden
  vector in `WearStatusCodecTest` and `:wear`'s `StatusTextTest`; a stopped or paused mesh reports no radio.
  Every read of the phone runs in `StatusReadJob` and no surface waits on Bluetooth (the fourth amendment: the
  watch app is a cached process, frozen ten seconds after a complication or tile poke, and dozing defers the asks);
  past the six-minute window a reading is drawn aged (`StatusText.shown`), and only a failed read says out of reach.
  A raised wrist does not end Doze, so while a complication is active `StatusAlarm` reads every five minutes on an
  allow-while-idle alarm; don't lean on `UPDATE_PERIOD_SECONDS` for freshness.
- **When touching `ui/yourmesh/`, `mesh/ContributionLedger`, `data/settings/ContributionJournal`,
  `data/peer/MetPeer*`, `ForwardDao.observeCarriedForOthers`, or the `onRelayed` / `onServed` hooks in
  `MeshRouter` / `ForwardSync`:** READ ADR 2026-09.2v2t. The Your mesh screen's numbers are shown to the user
  as things their phone *did*, so a credit happens only at a hand-off (this phone sent someone else's chat
  frame to ≥ 1 peer), once per frame, never for our own frames or a DM addressed to us; "handed straight to"
  is a live-link send and is never worded "delivered". "Nearby" and "met" both derive from
  `MeshController.neighbors` (ADR 2026-09.2ajk) — don't add a second gate. Counters flush on the 60 s tick,
  never per frame, and nothing here leaves the phone.
- **When touching `mesh/BlobExchange`, `FramedLink`'s `rxKey` / pending-file count, `MeshTransport.arrivingFiles`
  / `fileInFlightTo`, or what re-asks for a blob (`rewantMissingBlobs`, the tick's `onNeighborAdded`):** READ
  ADR 2026-09.4tx5 (and 2026-09.ptv8 for the database re-arm). A blob is served only to a fresh ask — nothing
  is pushed to a peer that did not just ask, there is no wanter set — and "is it on the way" is a read of the
  link, never a memo with a TTL: the receiver stays quiet for a hash whose header is in, the holder refuses a
  re-ask for a key still queued or streaming to that peer. The lab pins it with `LabTransport.holdFiles` and
  the `files` recorder (one copy per (hash, link)). **Before touching `FramedLink.rxFile`, `ArrivingFile`,
  `FileHeaderWire.size`, `MeshController.arrivals` / `arrivalTicker`, `ChatViewModel.arrivals` or
  `ui/chat/ArrivalIndicator`:** READ ADR 2026-10.y9qh — the chat's progress ring is the same read of the link
  (bytes in, and the size the header declared: a label, never a bound), polled only while an attachment the
  window shows is awaited, finite on screen, and a `size` that will not decode costs the label, never the file.
- **When touching a presence dot or an online / offline label** (Profile Details, Diagnostics' node
  sections, the Contacts dot): the four evidence tiers live in `ui/Reach.kt` — `Direct` is
  `MeshController.neighbors` (a short-range radio saw the peer's own radio), `Indirect` is
  `MeshController.heardIndirectly` (another phone handed us the peer's fresh, signed frame over the radio mesh —
  `mesh/RelayedPresence.kt`, ADR 2026-10.fw8g; presentation only, never a route), `LongRange` is the long-range
  reach set or a spool scope its peer recently pushed to (`mesh/spool/SpoolPresence.kt`, one function the dot
  reads at 45 min and the mesh at `SPOOL_COVER_MS` = 15 min), `Known` is a bare profile row — and both labelled
  surfaces derive from `reachOf` so they cannot disagree. READ ADR 2026-09.2ajk before loosening any tier;
  the Contacts list still draws a binary dot from `neighbors` alone.
- **When touching `MeshManager.watchReachable`, its `flooded` memo / `refloodKey`, or `PROFILE_REFLOOD_MIN_MS`:**
  READ ADR 2026-09.uc8p. The first-sighting profile flood is the NAN-only key bootstrap; it goes to a peer once
  per (frame id, peer) per `SeenSet.DEFAULT_TTL_MS` — the receivers' own window, so every copy it withholds is
  one they would drop — and a newcomer the 30 s floor skipped is never memoed. Keep `ackSync.onReachable` ahead
  of every throttle (ADR 2026-09.y5f3). Regression: `MeshManagerTest.aLingerFlap…` / `aProfileEditIsReflooded…`.
- **When touching `KeyExchange`'s cache / `profileFor` / `serveKey`, `peer_profiles` (`PeerProfileEntity`,
  `PeerRepository.recordProfileFrame`), or the key-ahead in `ForwardSync.onDigest` (`keylessSenders`):** READ ADR
  2026-09.g64k (it closes the case ADR 2026-09.9xuu set aside). A carrier keeps the signed profile each pin came
  from, so it can prove the key of anyone whose frames it serves after a restart and after custody lost the
  profile. A key goes point to point, never flooded, and only to a peer holding none of that sender's frames we
  hold. Don't fold the frame into `peers` (a `ByteArray` breaks its equality), and don't keep the profile in
  custody past the quota or TTL (that moves the convergent quota rule). Regression: `StrangerBacklogLabTest`,
  `ForwardSyncTest`'s `onDigestServes…Key…` cases.
- **When touching `BlobDao.observeSizes`, `BlobRepository.observeSizes`, or `ChatViewModel`'s `heldHashes` /
  `heldSizes`:** READ ADR 2026-09.fjcw. The chat's one blob-table subscription is keyed to the window's
  attachment hashes plus the staged one (`IN (:hashes)`, primary-key seeks), and an empty ask never builds a
  query — don't bring back the whole-table `observeSizes()` or a second subscriber; Room invalidates per table,
  so either one re-runs on every blob write anywhere while a chat is open. Regression:
  `ChatViewModelTest.blobSizesAreAskedForTheWindowsAttachmentsAndTheStagedOneOnly`.
- **When touching how a Nearby-room post's ✓✓ gets home** — `AckSync`'s ride hold / `RIDE_HOLD_MS`,
  `MeshTransport.coveredByInternet`, `ScopeSync.pushDirect` / `presentPeers`, `MeshRouter.handOn`, or
  `MeshManager.ownProfile`:
  READ ADR 2026-09.y5f3 (aa27's ride hold now has a 60 s deadline; the tick then goes to a spool the author
  was recently seen on — a signed `relay = false` frame pushed direct and accounted, never custodied on the
  acker — else over LoRa's targeted path; every DM-form frame to a spool-present peer stays off the board;
  a node's own profile has one set of bytes per publish stamp) and ADR 2026-09.wkbk (`MeshRouter.handOn` —
  a point-to-point frame addressed to a peer we hold a **live link** to takes that one hop, DM-form chat
  only, which is how a far pocket's tick reaches a board-less author behind the gateway; an acker with no
  board and no spool is still stranded). Then `docs/ENCRYPTED_RECEIPTS_REACTIONS.md`
  §5, spec §9.4 C-9.4-3, and `RoomTickPlanesLabTest` in `mesh/lab/` for the end-to-end shape.
- **When touching `ui/components/Avatar`, `ui/components/GroupAvatar`, `ui/theme/AvatarTint.kt`,
  `data/message/GroupFaces.kt`, `ui/util/ClusterGeometry.kt`, or the notification avatars in
  `notifications/NotificationAvatars`:** READ ADR 2026-09.j8c7. A photo-less avatar's colour is keyed on the
  **node id** (`avatarTintIndex`, pinned by `ColorSchemeTest`), from a static twelve-hue palette that
  `scripts/gen-avatar-palette.py` generates; under Material You `KnitTheme` harmonizes it toward the
  wallpaper's primary (a 15°-capped Oklch hue turn, tone kept), and the shade draws the same slot the same
  way. Pass a name as the key only for a face with no identity behind it. A photo-less **group** is a
  cluster of its other members (`groupFaceIds`: self out, by node id, at most four, at least two — else a
  people glyph on a disc tinted by the group id) laid out by `clusterCells`, which the shade draws from the
  same cells; renderers never re-sort — READ ADR 2026-09.zapp.
- **When touching a group's roster — `reconcileGroup`/`vetRoster`, `groupleave`, `GroupRepository.recordDeparture`
  / `recordRejoin`, `PendingGroupKeys`, `GroupKeyPayload.group` / `pinRosterFromSeed`, or how a member learns
  of a new group:** READ `docs/GROUP_FORWARD_SECRECY.md` §1 (the pinned founding roster) and §6.1
  (leave-rekey), then ADR 2026-09.v6fu and ADR 2026-09.mjaj. A group's id is the hash of its member set, so
  "the same people" is always the same group; membership shrinks only by your own signed leave and grows only
  by your own signed rejoin — nobody can add or remove anyone else. The seed carries the founding roster, so a
  member with no row pins the group from the seed through `reconcileGroup`'s one door (the relay-only case,
  #47); a seed without one (an older build's) is parked, never consumed.
- **When touching a group's photo — `groupPhotoDecision` / `photoWins` / `settleArrivedGroupPhoto` in
  `InboundPipeline`, `GroupEntity.photoHash` / `photoShownHash`, `GroupDao.awaitingPhoto` /
  `photoHashesNeedingFetch`, `BlobRepository.dropRefusedGroupPhoto`, or `GroupDetailsViewModel`'s set path:**
  READ ADR 2026-09.nxcq. `photoHash` is the photo this device decided on — stored the moment it is heard, and
  the only one `toGroupInfo` advertises — and `photoShownHash` the one that renders, once its bytes are local
  and screened; every surface reads the shown one, and a frame carrying the shown one brings #108 back. A clock
  tie keeps the held photo. The want is the row (no in-memory map), and a refused photo stays decided and keeps
  its verdict so nothing pulls it again. Regression: `AttachmentLabTest`'s two group-photo-pull scenarios.
- **When touching `data/backup/`, `ui/backup/`, `RestartActivity`, `KnitApplication.onCreate`'s pre-Koin
  block, `MeshManager.finishRestore`, `SeenSet.reopen`, `SettingsKeys.TRANSIENT_PREFIXES`, or adding a table
  or a DataStore key:** READ `docs/BACKUP_FORMAT.md` and ADR 2026-09.6mj7. A backup is one file sealed by a
  recovery key the app shows once and never keeps; custody and both ratchets are never carried
  (`BackupTables`, test-pinned to the schema — a new table must be classified), a restore is staged and
  verified in full before `READY` (both readers on the other side fail destructively), applied by the
  relaunched process before Koin, and finished on the first mesh start by one session reset per peer whose
  session was wiped (DM peers and every group's other members, ADR 2026-09.qerd). A restore is a **move** —
  the mesh has no clone tolerance — and the copy says so. The database copy goes
  through a raw single-connection driver on purpose (`ATTACH` is read-only to SQLite and lands on a pool
  reader; the SQLCipher layer rewrites `BEGIN` to `EXCLUSIVE`) — don't move it onto the Room connection.
- **When touching `RatchetSessions.sealResetDm`, `InboundPipeline.sendSessionReset` / `maybeRequestReset`,
  `MeshManager.seedSendFloorOpen`, or anything else that sends a DM session reset:** READ ADR 2026-09.qerd and
  `docs/FORWARD_SECRECY_RATCHET.md` §7. A reset the peer would refuse — a second root inside its one-minute
  floor — is never sealed: over our own unanswered init it *marks* that init (the reset ctl under it, v2,
  flagged) or declines, and on the heuristic's word over an init answered under a minute ago it declines.
  The group seed floor counts only sends under the pairwise root held now, never `force`. Regression:
  `RatchetSessionsResetTest`, and `RestoreLabTest` under `scripts/lab-chaos.sh`.
- **When touching `mesh/CloneWatch`, the self branch of `InboundPipeline.handleProfile`, the `clone_`
  settings keys, `ui/chatlist/CloneBanner`, the Settings clone row, or `ui/signout/`:** READ ADR
  2026-09.ypcc. One backup restored onto two phones is detected from the **profile stamp alone** — a
  `profile` under our own node id whose `sentAt` is past `SettingsStore.profilePublishedAt` was minted
  elsewhere; chat frames are not evidence (a `DatabaseKey` wipe empties the record they would be judged
  against) — gated on `restorePending`, undone by a dismissal only for frames stamped before it, and
  answered by one `broadcastProfile` per not-visible → visible edge so the other phone sees us too (never
  while lit: no ping-pong). "Sign out here" is `ActivityManager.clearApplicationUserData()` — the whole
  phone, grants included, so the next open is onboarding — not a file list and not the restore trampoline.
  A twin heard only over LoRa is invisible (the plane drops its own node id at ingest). Regression:
  `CloneWatchTest`, `CloneLabTest` (`MeshLab.node(sameIdentityAs)`, `MeshLab.retire`), `SignOutTest`.
- **When touching contact cards, the Add-by-link / share-link flow, deep links (`getknit.app/c`,
  `knit://`), or `mesh/IntroSync`:** READ `docs/CONTACT_CARD.md` (the card layout + golden vectors, the
  intro driver's rules, the assetlinks prerequisite) and `docs/SPOOL_PROTOCOL.md` §3.5 (the pair scope);
  decision record ADR 042. The card is versioned by `v` and additive under the WIRE_COMPAT rules; import
  never sets `verified`.
- **When touching `contacts/ContactRemover`, the profile's Remove contact (`ContactRemoval`),
  `SettingsStore.unaccept`, `IntroSync.cancel` / `MeshController.cancelIntro`, `contactStanding` /
  `groupsAcceptedOnlyThrough` in `ui/contacts/ContactUniverse.kt`, or what `MeshManager.onCommonsMember`
  accepts:** READ ADR 2026-09.adgd. A contact is derived, so removal clears our own signals — a group that
  rested on the peer is accepted first, the accept is cleared last, the DM thread goes — and never the peer
  row, the session, custody or the block list; nothing is sent. A group co-member stays a contact (only
  their own leave shrinks a roster), and a commons member is accepted on first sighting only. Regression:
  `ContactRemoverTest`, `ContactUniverseTest`, `BlockAndRequestLabTest`.
- **When touching relay invites — `getknit.app/r` / `knit://r`, `mesh/spool/RelayInvite`,
  `data/relay/RelayInviteApplier`, `ui/relay/RelayInviteSheet` / `RelayInviteInbox`, the relay row's
  Share / Copy, or the Add-contact preview's relay "Add":** READ `docs/RELAY_INVITE.md` (layout, the
  bearer-link trust rules, golden vectors, the daemon contract) and ADR 2026-09.tmbq. One unsigned link
  carries the relay URL *with* its `?k=` token and the commons secret; it is applied only through the
  sheet (host named, cost stated, the master switch's disclosure folded in), by the one applier both doors
  share — `acceptSpoolConsent()` stays the only consent write (ADR 063), a relay is matched by
  `SpoolUrl.redact`, and a different room secret at the same relay is a rotation.
- **When touching `data/commons/`, `mesh/spool/Commons*`, `ConversationKind.COMMONS`, or the relay row's
  Join/Leave:** READ ADR 2026-09.wx8e and `docs/SPOOL_PROTOCOL.md` §7.4. The commons is a private relay's
  group chat: members' `profile` frames pin them through the ordinary door and make them accepted contacts,
  posts are a non-custodial `commons` frame that lives on the one spool that runs the room and never touches
  the radios (`ScopeSync`'s second door, `InboundPipeline.deliverCommonsPost`), and a post ahead of its
  author's profile is parked, never quarantined. `Conversations.isPublicRoom` is true for it on purpose.
  **Hidden in shipped builds** behind `BuildConfig.COMMONS` (on in debug, off in release, `-Pcommons=`
  overrides): the one seam is the `CommonsStore` the DI hands `MeshManager` and `InternetRelayViewModel`,
  null while dark — don't add a second gate downstream of it; flip the release default when it is introduced.
- **When touching `mesh/crypto/scope/`, `mesh/spool/`, or the spool/internet-relay plane:** READ
  `docs/SPOOL_PROTOCOL.md` (the normative public spec; its §13 vectors are pinned by
  `ScopeVectorTest`/`SpoolRecordsTest` — change them only together), then the `ScopeSync` invariants in
  `.agents/rules/mesh.md`. The client plane carries DM **and group** scopes, off by default, with the
  relay/spool-list editor shipped (`ui/relay/`); the scope-config ctl and Tor are still deferred — CHECK
  `.agents/memory/roadmap.md` before building either, and the spec's Appendix A for what runs today. The plane also carries **attachments**
  (`mesh/spool/ScopeAttachments`, spec §4.5/§6.5/§7.3/§9.5) as a separate object class kept out of the
  scope digest on purpose. A group scope derives from the shared
  **group root** (`GroupKeyPayload.gr`, `mesh/spool/GroupRootPolicy`): any member may mint it, and its
  mint / gossip / adopt / departure-re-mint rules are spec §3.2 — read that before touching them. The
  reference daemon lives in the separate `knit-spool` repo. Before touching `SpoolStatus.connected`,
  `OkHttpSpoolDialer.failureReason`, the `no_hello` / `unreachable` verdicts, `InternetGate.routeChanges`,
  or the chat placeholder's `attachmentWait` line: READ ADR 2026-09.vej5 — connected is a completed hello,
  a route that swallows the socket is `unreachable`, and the chat names the *connected* relays only.
  Before touching `RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS`, who calls `ScopeSync.onScopeTableChanged`, `RatchetSessions.rootChanges`
  or `IntroSync.onPairsChanged`: READ ADR 2026-09.dcah — the scope table derives on its inputs' events and the
  60 s poll is only the net under the calendar; a hook that fires on an unchanged input is the old poll back.
- **When creating or modifying anything under `app/src/test/java/app/getknit/knit/mesh/lab/`:** RUN
  `scripts/lab-chaos.sh --tests '<Class>'` on the changed classes and ADOPT (Claude Code: spawn) the
  `mesh-lab-reviewer` persona in `.agents/personas/mesh-lab-reviewer.md` before calling the change done — every
  lab flake has been a scenario assuming an order the mesh does not promise. A Stop hook enforces the review.
  Chaos mode is the "Chaos mode" bullet in `.agents/context/testing.md`.
- **When adding, renaming or removing a `@Preview`, or touching `app/src/screenshotTest/`, a reference PNG under
  `app/src/screenshotTestDebug/reference/`, or the `composeScreenshot` plugin:** READ the "Compose preview
  screenshot tests" section of `.agents/context/testing.md` and ADR 2026-10.gtmm. Every public `@Preview` in main
  is a test: the wrappers are generated by `scripts/gen-screenshot-tests.py` (`--check` catches a preview without
  one), so after adding or renaming a preview run it, then `updateDebugScreenshotTest`, and review the PNGs —
  never hand-edit either. The render is one frame under a pinned UTC/en-US; the plugin is alpha by a recorded
  exception.
- **When writing or running tests, or checking accessibility:** READ `.agents/context/testing.md` (unit +
  Robolectric Room + the **mesh-in-a-box** multi-node JVM scenarios in `mesh/lab/` + seeded UI / FTL +
  black-box UIAutomator + the accessibility/ATF suite that mirrors the Play pre-launch report). A change to
  what two nodes exchange — a new ctl frame, a custody rule, a roster or key path — gets a `mesh/lab/`
  scenario ending in `assertConverged`, not only a single-SUT test against mocked repos.
- **When driving the app on a device:** obey `.agents/rules/devices.md` first, then RUN the `debug-bridge`
  skill (`scripts/bridge.sh`, the send→verify loop, which oracle answers what); per-action reference in
  `.agents/context/debug-bridge.md`. A new bridge action goes in the receiver's `when`, the debug manifest's
  filter, that file and the skill's index.
- **Before an architectural choice:** CONSULT `.agents/memory/decisions.md` — a generated router table
  over one-file-per-decision ADRs in `.agents/memory/decisions/`; open the files whose row matches, don't
  work from the titles. For what's deliberately deferred, CHECK `.agents/memory/roadmap.md`.
- **For maintainer-only workflows a public clone doesn't include** (release testing on physical devices,
  soak/convergence trials, store/marketing capture — and more over time): a local, gitignored **`.private/`
  overlay** may be present. If `.private/AGENTS.md` exists, load it as a nested router (nearest-wins); it is
  absent from public clones.

## Capabilities

- RUN skills in `.agents/skills/` — `kotlin-patterns` (idiomatic Kotlin), `material-3` (Compose M3),
  `debug-bridge` (drive and verify the app on a device), and `dotagents-standard` (maintain this AGENTS.md
  router / `.agents/` layout). Skills are vendored in
  the repo (real files under `.agents/skills/`, surfaced to Claude Code via `.claude/skills/` symlinks),
  so cloners get them without any global install.
- ADD a durable decision with `python3 scripts/adr.py new "<title>" --topics a,b`, write the body it
  scaffolds, then `python3 scripts/adr.py index`. Never hand-edit `.agents/memory/decisions.md` (generated)
  and never pick an ADR number: ids are minted `YYYY-MM.suffix` so parallel worktrees can't collide, while
  `001`-`067` keep their sequence forever. Update `.agents/memory/roadmap.md` as deferred scope ships.
- If a task needs context this router doesn't point to, treat the missing routing as a bug — do the work,
  then add the routing line here.
