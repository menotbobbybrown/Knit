## 0. How to read this document

### 0.1 Normative language

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY carry their RFC 2119 / RFC 8174 meanings
when
capitalised. Lowercase uses of those words are prose.

### 0.2 Requirement identifiers

Every normative statement carries a stable identifier so a conformance suite, a bug report or a code
comment can cite one line rather than a paragraph. Identifiers are append-only: a retired
requirement
keeps its number and is marked withdrawn.

| Prefix | Applies to                       |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| `S-`   | A spool implementation           |
| `C-`   | A member (client) implementation |
| `B-`   | Both                             |

### 0.3 Rationale is not normative

Blocks introduced by **Why.** explain a decision. They bind nobody. Everything else in a numbered
section is either a requirement or a definition.

### 0.4 Audience tags

Section headings carry `[Spool]`, `[Client]` or `[Both]`. A relay implementer needs no crypto at
all:
a spool never decrypts anything, so the entire key schedule is `[Client]`.

## 1. Overview [Both]

### 1.1 Purpose

Knit is an offline mesh messenger, and radio proximity is the product. This protocol extends
*existing*
conversations across the Internet when no radio path exists. It is a continuity layer for contacts
already made over the mesh, by QR, or by exchanging a **contact card** out of band (§3.5 — two people
who hold each other's card can meet at a spool before any session exists). It is not a discovery
network, not an account system and not a server in the sense that word usually implies: nothing here
finds a stranger, and nothing here is registered.

### 1.2 The moving parts

A **scope** is one conversation's Internet presence, either a DM pair or a group. Members derive its
id
and keys from secrets they already share (§3). Nothing about a scope is registered anywhere.

A **frame** is the mesh's frozen custody unit, `signed` + `sig` (ADR 005). A **blob** is one frame,
AEAD-encrypted under scope keys (§4) and addressed by the hash of its own ciphertext.

A **spool** is a small store-and-forward daemon (yarn waits on a spool). Per scope it holds a
bounded
set of blobs plus a digest over that set (§6), streams new arrivals to connected subscribers, and
heals
divergence by digest anti-entropy (§9). This is the delay-tolerant custody model the mesh already
runs,
scoped per conversation and blinded.

An **attachment** is the image bytes a frame references rather than carries: a second object class
on
the same scope, sealed and chunked (§4.5), stored under a per-scope byte quota (§6.5), and fetched
on
demand by whoever holds the referencing frame (§9.5). It sits outside the frame digest on purpose,
for
the reason §6.5 gives.

Two structural facts follow from the shape:

- Spools never talk to each other. A scope names several spools; every member pushes to and pulls
  from
  all of them, so **the client union is the federation**. A fresh or wiped spool is refilled by any
  one
  member, and no spool is load-bearing.
- A frame pulled from a spool re-enters the local mesh through the ordinary re-serve path (§9.4), so
  one
  Internet-connected member bridges a whole radio island in both directions with no new delivery
  semantics.

### 1.3 The trade, stated as loudly as the ratchet docs state theirs

A spool is a custody peer that can never read what it custodies. It learns opaque scope ids, blob
sizes
and timings, and subscriber IPs. It never learns node ids, content, rosters or delivery facts.
Content
moderation is impossible by construction, which is the privacy story and the abuse story at once,
and
§6.4's quotas and proof of work are the entire toolkit that remains. Spools are cattle: losing one
loses
nothing a member cannot refill.

### 1.4 Non-goals in v1

- Carrying the plaintext Nearby broadcast room (proximity semantic, spam surface). The **commons** (§7.4)
  is not that room: it is one keyed room per spool, private to whoever holds its invite, added on 2026-09-12.
- Contact discovery, or any server-side identity. (A pair that already holds each other's identity —
  from a card exchanged out of band — may rendezvous, §3.5; a spool still learns no identity from it.)
- Spool-to-spool federation.
- Resistance to a global passive network observer. Tor optionally covers the IP edge; padding is
  future
  study (§11).

## 2. Conventions and encodings [Both]

| ID        | Requirement                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B-2-1** | CBOR uses definite-length encoding only.                                                                                                         |
| **B-2-2** | Unknown map keys MUST be ignored on decode.                                                                                                      |
| **B-2-3** | Fields equal to their declared default MUST be omitted on encode.                                                                                |
| **B-2-4** | Map keys are the short field names given in §7.                                                                                                  |
| **B-2-5** | Every `ByteArray`-valued field, including byte-array list elements, MUST encode as a CBOR byte string (major type 2), never as an integer array. |
| **B-2-6** | Scope ids and blob ids are raw 32-byte strings on the wire. Lowercase hex is the display form in logs, diagnostics and this document.            |
| **B-2-7** | Digests are raw 8-byte big-endian byte strings, never CBOR integers.                                                                             |

Notation used in derivations:

- `u32be(n)` and `u64be(n)` are unsigned big-endian, 4 and 8 bytes.
- `‖` is concatenation; `A[i…j)` is a half-open byte range.
- The KDF is HKDF-SHA256 (RFC 5869) with salt = 32 zero bytes and `L` as stated per derivation. Info
  strings are the ASCII label concatenated with a context: `label ‖ context`.
- The AEAD is AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte nonce and a 128-bit tag.
- The hash is SHA-256 everywhere: blob ids, the seal's synthetic nonce input, proof of work.

| ID        | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B-2-8** | Labels live under `knit/scope/v1/…` (key plane) and `knit/spool/v1/…` (transport plane). These namespaces are disjoint from the app's `knit/dm/v2/…` and `knit/group/v1/…`, and no derivation here may cross-derive with the message ratchets. |
| **B-2-9** | Context strings use the house pipe separator, ASCII `0x7C`.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

> **Why B-2-7.** A high-bit digest carried as an integer drags every implementation into
> signed-integer
> encoding questions. A byte string has one representation.
>
> **Why B-2-9.** `|` cannot occur in a 26-character base32 node id or in a `g-`-prefixed hex group
> id, so
> delimited fields cannot alias each other.

## 3. Scopes and keys [Client]

### 3.1 DM scopes

The input is the pair's **pairwiseRoot**: the stable per-session export secret both sides derive
from the
DM ratchet (`docs/FORWARD_SECRECY_RATCHET.md` §8, `HKDF(sessionRoot, "knit/dm/v2/export/root")`).
With
`idLow`/`idHigh` the two node ids sorted lexicographically:

```
ctx      = UTF8(idLow ‖ "|" ‖ idHigh ‖ "|")
scopeId  = HKDF(ikm = pairwiseRoot, info = "knit/scope/v1/dm/id"  ‖ ctx, L = 32)
sealOkm  = HKDF(ikm = pairwiseRoot, info = "knit/scope/v1/seal"   ‖ ctx, L = 64)
sealKey  = sealOkm[0…32)        nonceKey = sealOkm[32…64)
```

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-3.1-1** | A DM scope follows the *active session*. A session replacement yields a new pairwiseRoot and therefore a new scope.                          |
| **C-3.1-2** | The retiring scope stays derivable from the retiring root for the ratchet's 48 h drain window, during which a member MAY keep it subscribed. |
| **C-3.1-3** | A retiring scope MUST be drained but never refilled: a member MUST NOT seal fresh frames into it.                                            |

> **Why the ids appear in the context.** Defence in depth only. The ikm is already pair-secret, so a
> spool holding both public node ids still cannot compute the scopeId.
>
> **On losing session state.** A device that loses its own session state cannot recover its scopes.
> Continuity dies with the session and re-establishment takes an out-of-band re-meet, over the mesh
> or by
> QR. That is coherent with a continuity layer for existing contacts, and it is a privacy property:
> scope
> ids are unlinkable across session eras.

### 3.2 The shared group root

The group sender-key scheme has no shared secret; `docs/GROUP_FORWARD_SECRECY.md` §8 defers exactly
this
object to here. The **group root** supplies it:

```
GroupRoot { root: 32 random bytes, version: Int (from 1), minter: nodeId }
```

Ordering, used throughout this section: `(version, minter)` compares `version` numerically, then
`minter` lexicographically.

#### Minting

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-3.2-1** | Any current member MAY mint `version = 1`, and only when it holds no root, has the Internet plane enabled for the group, and the group is fully ratchet-capable (§3.3). |
| **C-3.2-2** | The **preferred minter** is the creator if still a member, otherwise the smallest remaining node id. The preferred minter mints immediately.                            |
| **C-3.2-3** | Any other eligible member MUST wait `mintGrace` (§12) from when it first became eligible.                                                                               |
| **C-3.2-4** | The wait MUST be persistent state, not a process timer. A device that restarts hourly must not restart the clock.                                                       |

Competing v1 mints resolve by `(version, minter)`. The losing lineage's blobs are orphaned at spools
and
age out on `ttlMs`; members refill the winning scope through the ordinary §9.1 push half.

> **Why not creator-only.** The draft rule was creator-only, and its accepted gap was that a group
> whose
> creator never opts in gets no scope at all. The grace closes that gap while still damping
> concurrent
> mints, and it is the same mechanism that unfreezes a departure re-mint whose re-minter never comes
> back.

#### Distribution

Distribution is gossip on the existing seed channel. The root rides as additive fields of the
group-key
control payload (`GroupKeyPayload.gr`, `CTL_GROUP_KEY`, pairwise-sealed ctl DMs).

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-3.2-5** | Every seed send and key-request response from a member that holds a root MUST carry the newest root that member holds.            |
| **C-3.2-6** | A member receiving a distribution that carries a root older than its own, or none while it holds one, SHOULD answer with its own. |
| **C-3.2-7** | A member SHOULD NOT echo a root straight back to the member it just learned it from.                                              |
| **C-3.2-16** | Every seed send and key-request response MUST carry the group's founding roster (`GroupKeyPayload.group`: id, members, departed, creator, name). A member holding no row for the group pins it from the seed, under the same derivation check as a group frame, before applying C-3.2-8..13. |

> **Why C-3.2-6.** The root has no acknowledgment, so a stale gossip is the only evidence that an
> earlier
> distribution to that member was lost. Without the correction, a sender that believes it already
> delivered will never retry. The answer is self-terminating: once the lagging member adopts, its
> next
> distribution carries the same `(version, minter)` and the branch stops.
>
> **Why gossip at all.** The seed outbox, key-request and re-send machinery is already the delivery
> system, so root healing costs no new mechanism, and a wiped minter passively recovers the current
> root
> from the first seed DM it receives.
>
> **Why the roster rides too (C-3.2-16).** C-3.2-9 and C-3.2-10 vet the sender and the minter against the
> founding roster, so a member that holds no row cannot adopt the root. Its DM scope carries the seed; the
> roster rides only the group's own frames, which only the group scope admits (§4.4); and that scope derives
> from the very root it could not adopt. A group founded while a member was reachable only over the relay
> therefore never reached them until they met by radio. The founding roster is pinned at founding anyway,
> so carrying it on the seed trusts nothing new: the receiver verifies that the id is the hash of the
> founding set exactly as it does for a group frame.

#### Adoption

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-3.2-8**  | A member MUST adopt a carried root only when its `(version, minter)` is strictly greater than the held one. |
| **C-3.2-9**  | The carrying DM's sender MUST be in the pinned founding roster and not departed.                            |
| **C-3.2-10** | `minter` MUST itself be in the pinned founding roster.                                                      |
| **C-3.2-11** | `version` MUST satisfy `version ≤ held.version + maxRootVersionJump` and `version ≤ maxRootVersion` (§12).  |
| **C-3.2-12** | A root MUST NOT be v1-wrapped.                                                                              |
| **C-3.2-13** | Adoption MUST be idempotent, and MUST NOT be rate-limited.                                                  |

> **Why C-3.2-10.** Otherwise any member wins every tie forever by naming a lexicographically
> maximal
> minter id belonging to nobody.
>
> **Why C-3.2-11.** Otherwise one grief-mint at `2³¹ − 1` puts every future legitimate re-mint out
> of
> reach and freezes the scope permanently. A legitimate version never exceeds the founding roster
> size:
> one mint plus at most `size − 1` departures, and rosters never grow. §12's ceiling of 16 is double

#### Re-mint on departure

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-3.2-14** | On processing a signed `groupleave`, a member MUST record that a re-mint is due, in the same transaction as the leave-rekey send-chain reset.                 |
| **C-3.2-15** | The re-mint follows C-3.2-2/3/4: the deterministic re-minter mints `(fresh 32 bytes, version + 1)` immediately, any other remaining member after `mintGrace`. |

> **Why split the record from the mint.** That split is what makes rotation crash-safe, and the
> grace is
> what keeps a re-minter who is offline, or who has the plane switched off, from freezing rotation
> for
> everyone else. The leave-rekey already fans seed ctl DMs to every remaining member, so the new
> root
> rides them for free.

#### Convergence

Divergent departure views, and now several members reaching the end of their mint grace at once, can
transiently mint competing same-version roots. `(version, minter)` resolves them deterministically
and
the next processed departure mints strictly higher, so lineages collapse. A malicious member can
grief-rotate, bounded by C-3.2-11. That is the insider spam tier, the same posture as "a member can
spam
its own scope" (§6.4).

### 3.3 Group scopes

```
ctx      = UTF8(groupId ‖ "|") ‖ u32be(rootVersion)
scopeId  = HKDF(ikm = groupRoot, info = "knit/scope/v1/group/id" ‖ ctx, L = 32)
sealOkm  = HKDF(ikm = groupRoot, info = "knit/scope/v1/seal"     ‖ ctx, L = 64)  → sealKey ‖ nonceKey
```

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                           |

### 3.5 Pair scopes

A DM scope needs a confirmed session, a session needs the peer's prekey, and the prekey travels only on
a `profile` frame inside a scope the pair already shares — so two people who have only ever exchanged a
**contact card** (their identity bundle as a signed link, `docs/CONTACT_CARD.md`) have no scope to meet
at. The **pair scope** is that meeting point: a scope both can derive from the two identities alone.

```
pairSecret = X25519(IK_self, IK_peer)                    // the identity DH keys — the hpkePub half of each bundle
ctx        = UTF8(idLow ‖ "|" ‖ idHigh ‖ "|")             // the §3.1 context, verbatim
scopeId    = HKDF(ikm = pairSecret, info = "knit/scope/v1/pair/id" ‖ ctx, L = 32)
sealOkm    = HKDF(ikm = pairSecret, info = "knit/scope/v1/seal"    ‖ ctx, L = 64)  → sealKey ‖ nonceKey
```

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-3.5-1** | A member MUST subscribe a pair scope only while an intro with that peer is pending, or for a bounded grace (`pairGrace`, §12) after its own session with the peer confirms — then drop it.       |
| **C-3.5-2** | A pair scope carries exactly the §4.4 DM frame set, with the pending peer as the counterpart. It has no rule of its own.                                                                      |
| **C-3.5-3** | A pair scope exists to establish the session. Once the DM scope (§3.1) exists it supersedes the pair scope; a member MUST NOT rely on a pair scope for anything else.                        |
| **C-3.5-4** | A member SHOULD hold at most `maxPairScopes` (§12) pair scopes at once.                                                                                                                       |
| **C-3.5-5** | The pair secret is a static-static agreement used for nothing else; every derivation from it is labeled under `knit/scope/v1/…` (B-2-8) and never mixes with the ratchet's `knit/dm/v2/…`. |

> **Why the identity keys.** They are the one input both parties hold *before* a session: the card is
> self-certifying (the node id is the hash of the bundle it carries), so a pinned card is exactly the

## 4. Sealing [Client]

### 4.1 The sealed plaintext

```
pt = sig(64) ‖ signed
```

`signed` is the canonical `RelayEnvelope` CBOR, byte-for-byte what the mesh floods (ADR 005). No
wrapper
is needed: the signature is always exactly 64 raw Ed25519 bytes and every custodial frame is signed.
After unsealing, the ordinary inbound verification applies unchanged (§4.4).

### 4.2 Key schedule: the outer seal is scope-static

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-4.2-1** | One seal key per scopeId, derived in §3, rotating exactly when the scopeId rotates.        |
| **C-4.2-2** | A blob's leading byte is the seal-scheme version. For the frame seal it is `sealv = 0x01`. |

Key selection is therefore a bijection with the scope: a blob pulled from scope S opens under S's
one
key. No hints, no trial decryption.

> **Why this amends the design-phase intent.** The design phase said "sealing keys rotate with
> ratchet
> epochs". Recorded here so it is not relitigated: per-epoch outer keys fail twice.
>
> 1. **DM fresh-epoch bootstrap.** The epoch identifiers needed to select a key (`se`/`ek`/`pe` in
     the
     > ratchet header) live *inside* the sealed blob, and a fresh epoch's key depends on a new DH
     public key
     > also inside it. The receiver of a first-of-epoch blob could neither select nor enumerate the
     key.
     > Deadlock by construction.
> 2. **Group seed-lag visibility inversion.** A blob sealed under a sender's epoch export would be
     > unopenable by exactly the seed-lagging member: the member for whom the frame must stay
     *visible* so
     > it custodies, re-floods and counts the undecryptable-frame signal that drives seed
     key-requests.
     > Epoch-sealing would starve the group scheme's own recovery loop.
>
> The cost is stated in §10: the outer seal protects **routing metadata** with a scope-generation
> horizon,
> not an epoch horizon. **Content** confidentiality and forward secrecy belong entirely to the inner
> v2
> schemes and are untouched, since what is inside `signed` is already epoch-ratcheted ciphertext. An
> epoch-keyed outer seal stays reachable as `sealv = 2` (§11), and the ratchet `exportEpochSeal`
> surfaces
> are reserved for it.

### 4.3 The deterministic seal

Spools dedupe by blob id, and any member may independently push the same frame, so sealing MUST be a
pure
function of (scope, frame).

```
nonce   = HKDF(ikm = nonceKey, info = "knit/scope/v1/nonce" ‖ SHA-256(pt), L = 12)
aad     = "knit/scope/v1" ‖ scopeId
ct      = AES-256-GCM(key = sealKey, nonce, pt, aad)
blob    = 0x01 ‖ nonce(12) ‖ ct
blobId  = SHA-256(blob)
```

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-4.3-1** | Sealing MUST be deterministic: identical `(scope, frame)` MUST produce identical blob bytes.       |
| **C-4.3-2** | The synthetic nonce MUST be keyed by `nonceKey`. An unkeyed `SHA-256(pt)` nonce is non-conforming. |
| **C-4.3-3** | The aad MUST be `"knit/scope/v1" ‖ scopeId`.                                                       |

> **Nonce-reuse analysis.**
>
> - The nonce is a keyed synthetic IV, SIV-style, built from HKDF and SHA-256. No new primitive is
    > introduced. Identical frame ⇒ identical `(key, nonce, pt)` ⇒ identical blob ⇒ identical
    blobId, so
    > cross-uploader dedup and digest convergence hold by construction and a re-push is
    byte-identical.
> - Two *distinct* plaintexts collide on `(key, nonce)` only through a SHA-256 collision, or the
    2⁻⁹⁶
    > birthday over a per-scope set bounded by `maxFrames`. Negligible. The only parties able to
    *attempt* to
    > manufacture one are seal-key holders, that is, scope members, who can already read every blob
    in the
    > scope. GCM's nonce-reuse failure mode grants them nothing they lack.
> - The keying is load-bearing against a **confirmation oracle**. An unkeyed nonce would let a spool
    that
    > holds candidate frame bytes (say a cleartext-payload `groupleave` observed on the mesh)
    recompute the
    > nonce and link a mesh identity to a scopeId. `HKDF(nonceKey, …)` closes it.
> - The aad binds the scope and the scheme label, so a blob replanted into another scope, or fed to
    a
    > future scheme, fails authentication before any content parses.

| **C-4.4-2** | A blob failing any step MUST be discarded and quarantined (§9.3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **C-4.4-12** | A frame that passes MUST re-enter delivery inside a fresh mesh envelope with a full hop budget, through the custody re-serve path (§9.4). |

Dedup, idempotent delivery and roster vetting are the existing inbound gates, unchanged.

### 4.5 Attachments

A chat frame does not carry its image; it names one. The name is the *ciphertext* hash of the
attachment
and it rides the mesh in cleartext on the frame, so a carrier blind to the sealed content can still
custody the bytes. Two frame shapes name one (§9.5 lists them). The plane carries the bytes as a
second
object class beside frames.

The input is that attachment ciphertext `A`: already AEAD-encrypted end to end under a fresh
per-send key
that lives inside the sealed `MessageContent`, and already content-addressed by
`aHash = SHA-256(A)`.
This layer does not re-protect content that is already opaque. It blinds the *routing* of it,
exactly as
§4.2's outer seal does for frames.

## 5. Scope configuration [Client]

A scope's operating parameters ride *inside the conversation itself*, end-to-end sealed like any
message.
A spool never sees spool lists or bounds provenance, and the config propagates over mesh and spools
alike
with no side channel.

```
CTL_SCOPE_CONFIG = 7      MessageContent.sc: ScopeConfigPayload?
ScopeConfigPayload {
    groupId: String?      // null ⇒ the DM pair of this ctl's endpoints
    spools:  [String]     // WSS URLs (may embed ?k= bearer tokens, §7.1)
    maxFrames: Int        // retention bounds the members assume and declare at SUB (§6.2)
    ttlMs:   Long
    maxBlob: Int
    version: Int          // monotonic per conversation
}
```

## 6. The spool [Spool]

### 6.1 Data model

Per scope, a spool holds nothing but:

- `blobId → (blob, arrivedAt)`, the live set;
- a **tombstone set** of evicted and expired blob ids, bounded, expiring on the same `ttlMs` clock;
- the rolling **digest** over the live blob-id set (§6.3);
- subscriber connections.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-6.1-1** | A spool MUST NOT keep accounts, user rows, or any cross-scope index beyond the scope table. |

A spool that loses its disk is refilled by any member through §9. Spools are cattle.

### 6.2 Bounds, eviction, tombstones

A sealed frame hides its send time, so a spool orders by what it can see.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-6.2-1** | A spool MUST evict oldest-by-`arrivedAt` when a scope exceeds `maxFrames`, and MUST expire a blob at `arrivedAt + ttlMs`.                        |
| **S-6.2-2** | Applied per-scope bounds are the most recent SUB's declaration, **clamped** to the spool's HELLO-advertised hard caps.                           |
| **S-6.2-3** | DIGEST MUST echo the applied bounds plus a `full` flag.                                                                                          |
| **S-6.2-4** | Evicted and expired ids MUST enter the tombstone set; a PUSH matching a tombstone MUST be refused `tombstoned` and MUST NOT re-enter the digest. |
| **S-6.2-5** | LIST responses MUST carry the tombstone ids.                                                                                                     |
| **S-6.2-6** | On PUSH a spool MUST verify `blobId = SHA-256(data)` (refuse `bad_id`) and MUST enforce `maxBlob`.                                               |
| **S-6.2-7** | Tombstone sets MUST be count-bounded as well as TTL'd, dropping oldest first (§12).                                                              |

Different spools may therefore hold different sets. That is fine: spools never sync with each other
and
clients union them.

**Forgotten scopes.** A spool may forget a scope entirely, through watermark shedding (§6.4), an
operator wipe, or a restart of a non-persistent spool, while connections still hold subscriptions
for it.

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-6.2-8**  | The subscription survives on the connection. `list`/`pull` against a forgotten scope MUST answer empty (an empty `list` response, all ids `missing`) and MUST NOT error. |
| **S-6.2-9**  | The next `push` **recreates** the scope, applying §6.4's creation gates exactly as for an unknown scope id.                                                              |
| **S-6.2-10** | On recreation the bounds re-apply from the connection's most recent declaration, and the spool MUST send the recreated scope's fresh `digest` before the push's `ok`.    |

### 6.3 The digest

```
digest(S) = XOR over b ∈ S of FNV1a64(b)      // b = the raw 32-byte blobId
FNV1a64: h = 0xcbf29ce484222325; per byte: h = (h XOR byte) × 0x00000100000001b3 (mod 2⁶⁴)
digest(∅) = 0
```

Order-independent and self-inverse, so add and remove are O(1). Wire form is 8 bytes big-endian as a
byte
string (B-2-7). This is the mesh's custody digest with raw-byte input instead of UTF-8 frame-id
strings.

|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-6.4-1** | Per-scope quotas (§6.2) apply, so a spamming member thrashes only its own conversation.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **S-6.4-2** | The first SUB or PUSH for an unknown scope id MAY demand a PoW stamp (§8), at the difficulty advertised in HELLO.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **S-6.4-3** | A spool SHOULD cache accepted `(scopeId, day)` pairs so honest clients pay roughly once per scope.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **S-6.4-4** | Per-IP and per-connection rate limits are signalled with `rate` + `retryMs`.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **S-6.4-5** | A global storage watermark with oldest-scope shedding is operator policy. When a spool sheds, the recommended shape is a **whole-scope drop, tombstones included**, followed by an empty `digest` (count 0, digest 0) to that scope's still-connected subscribers. |

### 6.5 Attachments at the spool

A spool that supports attachments (it says so in HELLO, §7.3) keeps, per scope, a second table
alongside
§6.1's: per `aid`, the declared `total`, the bytes held, an `arrivedAt`, and the stored chunks keyed
by
index. Chunks are opaque, exactly like frame blobs.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-6.5-1** | The attachment quota is per-scope **bytes** (`maxAttachBytes`), taken from the spool's own HELLO. It MUST NOT be part of the SUB-declared bounds.     |
| **S-6.5-2** | Over budget, a spool MUST evict the oldest whole `aid` by `arrivedAt`, never individual chunks.                                                       |
| **S-6.5-3** | An attachment that cannot fit the budget even alone MUST be refused `quota`.                                                                          |
| **S-6.5-4** | TTL is stamped at the first chunk and MUST NOT be extended by later chunks.                                                                           |
| **S-6.5-5** | Tombstones apply in §6.2's shape, with the same TTL and count bound: `aput` against a dead `aid` is refused `tombstoned`, and `ahave` answers `dead`. |
| **S-6.5-6** | On `aput` a spool MUST verify `cid = SHA-256(data)` (refuse `bad_id`) and MUST enforce `maxAChunk` and the byte quota.                                |
| **S-6.5-7** | First write wins at a position: an identical `cid` is acked idempotently, a differing one is refused `conflict`.                                      |
| **S-6.5-8** | A whole-scope shed drops that scope's attachments and their tombstones with it.                                                                       |
| **S-6.5-9** | Attachments MUST NOT be folded into the scope digest.                                                                                                 |

| **B-7.1-1** | Transport is WSS (TLS WebSocket). URL shape: `wss://host[:port]/spool/v1[?k=<token>]`.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **C-7.1-2** | A client MUST refuse a non-TLS spool URL. Development builds MAY allow `ws://`; release builds MUST NOT, at entry and again at dial time.                                                                                                     |
| **S-7.1-3** | A private spool MUST compare `k` in constant time and close `4001` before HELLO on mismatch.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **B-7.1-4** | Exactly one CBOR record per WebSocket binary message. WS provides the framing.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **B-7.1-5** | Each direction sends `hello` first. The spool advertises `v` (highest supported record-layer version), `min`, `limits` and `powBits`; the client answers with the chosen `v` in `[min, v]`, and nothing else identifying in either direction. |
| **B-7.1-6** | No version overlap closes `4002`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **B-7.1-7** | A `hello` *after* negotiation is malformed in-band traffic: answer `err malformed` and keep the connection. Close `4000` covers pre-hello traffic only.                                                                                       |
| **B-7.1-8** | The client stamps `q`, monotonically increasing per connection; terminal responses (`ok`/`err`) echo it. Server-initiated records (`digest`, `event`, `blob`, `achunk`) carry no `q`.                                                         |
| **B-7.1-9** | All scope operations require a prior `sub` for that scope on the same connection, `not_subscribed` otherwise.                                                                                                                                 |
| **S-7.1-10** | A spool at its connection cap MAY refuse the upgrade at the transport layer with `503`, and SHOULD send `Retry-After`. It MUST NOT use a close code to say so.                                                                              |
| **C-7.1-11** | A client MUST treat a refused upgrade as a transient transport failure and keep its own reconnect backoff. It SHOULD apply a `Retry-After` as a *floor* on the next wait, and MUST keep its jitter on top.                                  |

WS close codes: `4000` malformed pre-hello traffic · `4001` auth · `4002` version · `4003` abuse.

*Rationale (S-7.1-10, C-7.1-11).* None of the four close codes means "come back later", and `4003`
would tell a client it misbehaved when it did not — being full is a property of the box, not of the
protocol, so it is reported in the layer that owns capacity. The floor-not-replacement rule is what keeps
a long refusal from getting cheaper over time, and the jitter is what stops a population of clients one
spool turned away in the same instant from returning in the same instant.

### 7.2 Frame records

Field names are the CBOR map keys. `bstr32`/`bstr8` are byte strings of that length.

|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B-7.2-1** | `version` is reserved and MUST NOT be emitted in v1. A hello mismatch is close `4002`, not a record. The code exists so a future record-level versioning use never has to recycle it. |
| **B-7.2-2** | `conflict` is emitted only by `aput` (§7.3).                                                                                                                                          |
| **S-7.2-3** | A spool SHOULD send a fresh `digest` to a scope's subscribers whenever the live set changes beyond a single acked push: eviction pressure, TTL expiry, a watermark shed.              |
| **C-7.2-4** | A client MUST NOT *rely* on unsolicited `digest`. It is best-effort fan-out like `event`; §9.1 on reconnect is the correctness anchor.                                                |
| **S-7.2-5** | A `pull` beyond `maxPull` MUST be truncated to `maxPull`, never answered with an error. Ids beyond the cap appear in neither `blob`s nor `missing`.                                   |
| **C-7.2-6** | A client that overshoots `maxPull` re-pulls the remainder.                                                                                                                            |
| **S-7.2-7** | A duplicate `push` (blobId already live) MUST be acked `ok` with **no** `event` fan-out. The push row's fan-out applies to newly stored blobs only.                                   |

| **S-7.3-1** | Indices the spool lacks simply do not arrive from `aget`. Nothing enumerates them back, and `ok.missing` stays a frame-only field.                          |
| **S-7.3-2** | An `aget` overshooting `maxAget` MUST be truncated, never answered with an error (S-7.2-5, reapplied).                                                      |
| **S-7.3-3** | `aput` follows §6.5: `cid` verified, `maxAChunk` and the byte quota enforced, tombstones refused, first write wins with `conflict` on a differing re-write. |
| **S-7.3-4** | Attachments MUST NOT be fanned out with `event`.                                                                                                            |
| **S-7.3-5** | A spool advertises attachment support by including `maxAttachBytes`, `maxAChunk` and `maxAget` in HELLO's `limits`: all three, or none.                     |
| **C-7.3-6** | A client MUST NOT send `ahave`/`aget`/`aput` to a spool that omitted them.                                                                                  |

### 7.4 The commons

One optional **shared scope per spool**: a room for everyone on a private relay — a household, a team,
one organisation — where the members hold an invite and the spool holds only the invite's hash. The
reference daemon implements the spool half (`knit-spool commons-invite`, `SPOOL_COMMONS_*`); the
derivations and the client half are normative here.

**The invite and its two halves.** The invite is `knit-commons:v1:<base64url, unpadded>` around a
32-byte `secret`.

```
scopeId = SHA-256(UTF8("knit/spool/v1/commons") ‖ secret)                       // the spool's half
sealOkm = HKDF(ikm = secret, info = "knit/spool/v1/commons-key", L = 64)         // the members' half
sealKey = sealOkm[0…32)        nonceKey = sealOkm[32…64)
```

The id is a bare hash under the transport-plane prefix rather than an HKDF under `knit/scope/v1/…`
(B-2-8) because the *spool* computes it — from `SPOOL_COMMONS_ID`'s secret, at boot — and the daemon
owns that derivation; the seal keys follow it into the same family so the two halves read as one
invite. A spool never learns `secret` and implements no key derivation at all, which is what makes "the
spool cannot read its own commons" structural rather than a promise.

|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-7.4-1**  | A spool with a commons advertises it in HELLO as `commons: { name?, maxFrames, ttlMs, maxBlob, attach? }` (`attach` omitted when false). It MUST NOT include the scope id in any form. Presence of the field is the capability signal.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **S-7.4-2**  | The commons' bounds are the operator's, pinned. A `sub` for it MUST apply those bounds, ignoring what the client declared, and echo the applied bounds in the `digest` (S-6.2-3 unchanged).                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **S-7.4-3**  | The scope exists from the spool's boot, so it is never an unknown scope: the §6.4 creation gates (proof of work, the new-scope bucket) MUST NOT apply to it, and a spool MUST NOT shed it under the storage watermark.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **S-7.4-4**  | Pushes into the commons are bounded by a **spool-wide** budget in addition to the per-connection one. A refusal under it is `err rate` with `retryMs`, and MUST NOT count as a strike (§6.4) — congestion on a shared room is not evidence any one member misbehaved.                                                                                                                       |
| **S-7.4-5**  | Attachment records (§7.3) naming the commons are answered `err malformed` unless the spool advertised `attach = true` for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **C-7.4-6**  | The commons frame set: `type = profile` from any sender, and `type = commons` whose payload names *this* scope id and carries no `enc` and no attachment, from a sender whose key is pinned. Both address nobody (`recipientId` and `group` unset). Nothing else — no receipts, no reactions, no DM-form chat. On the push side a member seals only its **own** frames.                        |
| **C-7.4-12** | A post's delivery receipt MUST NOT enter the commons scope. A member that wants to acknowledge one does so as it would a group message: a sealed receipt to the author, carried by the pair's own DM scope (§3.1) once a session exists.                                                                                                                                              |
| **C-7.4-7**  | A `profile` pulled from the commons re-enters delivery through §9.4 unchanged (it pins the member). A `commons` post MUST NOT: it is delivered to the room's thread through its own door and is never custodied, originated or relayed on the mesh. §9.4 does not apply to it.                                                                                                              |
| **C-7.4-8**  | A `commons` post whose sender is not yet pinned MUST be deferred, not quarantined (§9.3): the listing is unordered and the member's profile is on its way. The deferral MUST be bounded, after which the blob is quarantined.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **C-7.4-9**  | Every accepted blob in a commons is accounted (§9.6), a post because custody never holds it and a profile because the member's push set is its own frames only. The accounted bound MUST clear the pinned `maxFrames`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **C-7.4-10** | A member keeps its own `profile` live in the commons: it is pushed with the member's posts, and when the spool tombstones it (count-evicted inside the member's republish window) the member MUST publish a fresh stamp rather than wait. An id the spool has tombstoned MUST be dropped from the member's local fold for that scope.                                                          |
| **C-7.4-11** | A commons is subscribed at exactly the spool that runs it, and only once that spool's HELLO has advertised one. A member MUST NOT mine proof of work for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

> **What it is not.** Not the Nearby room (§1.4): the room is keyed, private to its invite, and its authors are

### 7.5 Send-side moderation

An operator who answers for the people on a spool — a school, a workplace, a household — may require
that what members send through it has passed the client's own on-device content screen. The spool
holds ciphertext and can screen nothing itself (§10.2); what it can do is state the requirement in
HELLO, and a conforming client honours it before it seals. The reference daemon exposes it as
`SPOOL_REQUIRE_MODERATION`.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-7.5-1** | A spool that requires send-side moderation advertises `moderation: true` in HELLO. A spool that does not MUST omit the field; `false` is never sent. Presence is the signal.                                                                                                                             |
| **S-7.5-2** | Nothing else changes at the spool: no record, error code, close code or bound is added, and a spool MUST NOT attempt to infer or enforce compliance — it holds ciphertext and cannot.                                                                                                                    |
| **C-7.5-3** | A client MUST run its send-side content screen on every frame and attachment it *originates* into a scope that any `moderation`-advertising spool carries, and MUST NOT push content the screen flags — to any spool of that scope, not only the requiring one.                                          |
| **C-7.5-4** | The block MUST NOT be overridable by the sender. A client that ordinarily offers a "send anyway" confirmation withdraws it for such a scope.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **C-7.5-5** | Strictest wins: the rule applies while *any* spool the client would push the scope to advertises `moderation`, judged from the HELLOs of the current connections. A client MUST NOT carry a remembered absence past a reconnect.                                                                        |
| **C-7.5-6** | Receive-side behaviour is the recipient's own: what a client does with content it *receives* — hide, blur, reveal — stays under the recipient's setting, and a spool's `moderation` MUST NOT force or forbid it.                                                                                         |
| **C-7.5-7** | Frames a client relays but did not originate — the §9.4 mesh bridge, a §9.1 re-push — are outside the rule: the relaying client may not hold the plaintext, and the originator's client was the one bound.                                                                                               |

> **A request, not an enforcement.** A tampered client can ignore the field exactly as it can skip
> any sender-side check, and no spool can tell. Receive-side screening is what survives a hostile
> sender, which is why C-7.5-6 leaves it in the recipient's hands rather than letting an operator
> switch it off along with the sender's override. What the flag buys is that every *conforming*
> client on the spool refuses the same content the same way, with nothing for a well-meaning sender
> to click past.
>
> **Why strictest wins.** The sender seals a frame once and pushes identical bytes to every spool it
> knows (§1.2, §4.3). A per-spool split — withhold from the requiring spool, deliver to the rest — would
> let one operator's policy silently fork the conversation, with the members who reach it only
> through that spool never learning what they missed.
>
> **Why "originates".** The bridge and the heal loop relay sealed bytes. A relaying member may be
> unable to open them at all, and where it can, the frame was already screened by the client that
> was bound to screen it.

## 8. Proof of work [Both]

Stateless Hashcash, the Nostr NIP-13 family, over data both sides already share. No server challenge
round-trip.

```
input   = "knit/spool/v1/pow" ‖ scopeId(32) ‖ u64be(day) ‖ u64be(n)

|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S-8-1** | A spool MUST accept `day ∈ {today − 1, today, today + 1}` and no wider. |

## 9. Anti-entropy: the client procedure [Client]

### 9.1 The heal loop

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.1-1** | On a `digest` mismatch against the local expectation for a scope, a client MUST request `list`, diff the spool's live set against local custody minus tombstoned ids, `pull` what is missing locally and `push` what the spool lacks. |
| **C-9.1-2** | The loop MUST be bidirectional.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **C-9.1-3** | A client MUST refuse a `list` answer whole — never truncate it — when it names more live ids than the client's own per-scope tracking bound (§12.2) or more tombstones than the tombstone count bound (§12.2), and MAY treat it as a spool fault. |
| **C-9.1-4** | A client SHOULD bound how long it waits on a spool that accepts requests and answers none: a request timeout, and after a small number of consecutive unanswered requests, the connection itself is dropped with the ordinary reconnect backoff. |
| **C-9.1-5** | A client SHOULD NOT re-`sub` a scope the spool refused (`quota`, `pow`) on every heal round; it parks the scope for a window of its own choosing, taking the spool's `retryMs` as a hint inside that window only. |

> **Why C-9.1-3 refuses rather than truncates.** A conforming spool's live set fits its applied
> `maxFrames` and its tombstones the §12.2 count bound, while the record cap alone admits thousands of
> ids — enough to churn a client's bounded per-scope sets every round and pin its worker in pull round
> trips. A truncated view would re-anchor the client on a partial set and re-list forever; refusing the
> round costs one `list` per tick. The threshold is the client's *tracking* bound rather than its declared
> `maxFrames` because S-6.2-2 applies the most recent SUB's declaration, which a newer member may have raised.

### 9.2 The outward dead-on-arrival guard

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.2-1** | A client MUST NOT push a frame whose cleartext-to-members `sentAt + ttlMs` (the scope's TTL, not the mesh custody TTL) has already lapsed. |

The mesh's custody store applies the same rule inward, so an expired frame neither enters local
custody
nor bounces between client and spool eviction. §6.2's guards close the loop from the spool side.

### 9.3 The invalid set

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.3-1** | A pulled blob that fails the hash check, the AEAD, the signature or the frame-set rule (§4.4) MUST enter a bounded per-spool **invalid set** keyed by blobId. |
| **C-9.3-2** | An invalid-set entry MUST never be re-pulled, never counted as held and never re-pushed.                                                                      |
| **C-9.3-3** | An invalid-set entry MAY be dropped once a `list` for its scope no longer names the id — unlisted, it can no longer be re-pulled, and holding it would only refuse a clean re-push of the same id after the garbage copy expired. |
| **C-9.3-4** | A blob the client did **not** pull — an `event` — that fails §4.4 MUST NOT enter the invalid set. It is dropped; if the spool holds it, a later `list` names it and C-9.3-1 applies. |

### 9.4 The mesh bridge

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.4-1** | A blob that passes §4.4 MUST re-enter delivery wrapped in a fresh mesh envelope with a full hop budget — the custody re-serve shape: same `signed`/`sig`, ttl reset, hops 0 — flowing through the ordinary inbound path. |
| **C-9.4-2** | Symmetrically, frames the member custodies for a scope, whether from the mesh or from its own sends, are sealed and pushed.                                                                                              |
| **C-9.4-3** | A member MAY push a frame it does **not** custody, under the same §4.4 frame-set rule, the same C-9.2-1 guard and the same size bounds as any push — and MUST then account it per §9.6, so its own digest folds the blob it will never hold and its own heal loop never pulls it back. The receiving member sees an ordinary blob (C-9.4-1). |

Flood-dedup, idempotent persistence, roster vetting and custody capture are all unchanged. One
Internet-connected member thus bridges a whole radio island in both directions with zero new
delivery
semantics.

> **Why C-9.4-3.** A room post's delivery tick is a `relay = false` frame by design — point-to-point,
> never flooded, never custodied, because one custody row per acker on every carrier is more than a
> room's tick is worth (ADR 2026-09.aa27). When the author is reachable through the relay and nothing
> else, the tick still has a scope it belongs in; the direct push puts it there without the custody
> step, and the accounting is what keeps the pusher's digest honest about a blob it deliberately does not
> hold. `relay` is not part of the sealed record, so the author pulls it as any frame and custodies it as
> any receipt it pulls — the "no custody row" holds on the pusher (ADR 2026-09.y5f3).

### 9.5 Attachments: fetch and refill

Both working sets are derived from what the member already holds. This plane persists nothing about
attachments.

**want(scope)** is the live custodied frames that pass §4.4 for the scope and name an attachment
this
scope may carry, whose bytes are absent locally. **have(scope)** is the same set with the bytes
present.

Two frame shapes name an attachment, and where the name lives differs per type exactly as the
frame-set
rule's group id does:

| Frame type    | Field                                             | Covers                                                                                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chat`        | `ChatContent.attachmentHash`                       | message images, and peer **avatars**, since a sealed `CTL_PROFILE` frame sets the same cleartext hint |
| `groupupdate` | `GroupInfo.photoHash`                             | the group's own picture; a groupupdate is already scope-eligible, so only the bytes were missing      |

`groupleave` names no image, and everything else fails the frame-set rule first.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.5-1** | References MUST be deduped by hash, keeping the newest `sentAt` and the first mime seen. A frame need not name a mime at all — a `groupupdate` never does, and a `chat` frame does so only on an older sender — so a fetcher MUST tolerate its absence.                                                       |
| **C-9.5-2** | Per heal round, per (spool, scope), a client works a small bounded number of attachments at a time.                                                         |
| **C-9.5-10** | When no reference names a mime, a fetcher SHOULD take the type from its own record of the message that names the attachment, and MUST fall back to a default when it has none. The type is never needed to *fetch* — only to store and render.                                                             |

The round, per attachment:

1. `ahave` for the `aid` (§4.5). `dead` ⇒ give up on this spool for this attachment. `total = 0` ⇒
   nothing to pull, though the push half may still apply.
2. `aget` the indices the bitmap marks absent locally, in `maxAget` batches. Open each chunk, check
   its
   header against what was requested, buffer it.
3. When complete, verify `SHA-256(reassembled) = aHash` and hand the bytes to the ordinary local
   blob
   store, so screening, the message row and the UI all update exactly as they do after a radio pull.
4. Push half: `aput` the indices the bitmap marks missing at the spool, bounded by the byte budget
   and by
   §9.2's guard applied to the newest frame that references the attachment.

> **Local screening is the client's.** Step 3's store screens what it receives exactly as a radio pull's
> does, so a client that refused an image and dropped its bytes (the Android client, content filtering on)
> MAY skip steps 1–3 for that attachment rather than fetch it again only to drop it. That is local policy: it
> touches neither digest (§4.5 keeps attachments out of them) nor the push half, which needs bytes it no
> longer holds.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.5-3** | A retiring scope (§3.1, §3.3) is pulled but never refilled, mirroring frames.                                                                              |
| **C-9.5-4** | Any failure — AEAD, a header that does not match the request, a final hash mismatch — MUST quarantine the `aid` per (spool, scope), extending §9.3's rule. |
| **C-9.5-11** | An attachment quarantine MAY expire after the scope's `ttlMs`, measured from when it was recorded: by then the copy that failed has left an honest spool (S-6.5-4), and presence is asked for, never listed, so no `list` can retire it the way C-9.3-3 does. |

> **Why a reference may carry no mime.** The mesh frame used to repeat the attachment's MIME beside its

>
> **Why C-9.5-4.** The argument is identical to §9.3's: a spool is untrusted storage, and without an

#### Deferring the push half

Attachments are the expensive object class, and a photo that crossed a radio link needs no second
copy at
a relay.

|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.5-5** | A member MAY defer the push half for an attachment while it holds positive evidence that the mesh is already carrying those bytes.                                                   |
| **C-9.5-6** | A deferral is a delay, never a refusal. It MUST re-open on its own when the evidence lapses, without waiting for new local activity.                                                 |
| **C-9.5-7** | A deferral MUST end while the referencing frame can still drive a push, since want and have are derived from custody and an attachment stops being nameable once its frame ages out. |
| **C-9.5-8** | The evidence MUST be per-recipient, and it MUST be able to expire. A permanent signal such as a delivery ack cannot satisfy C-9.5-6 on its own.                                      |
| **C-9.5-9** | This option covers attachments only. Frames MUST NOT be deferred on any such signal.                                                                                                 |

> **Why C-9.5-8.** A frame can be acked while its bytes were never fetched, because an attachment
> travels
> by a separate demand-driven pull. Consequently a **group** scope cannot satisfy this rule in v1:
> its

### 9.6 The accounted set

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C-9.6-1** | A pulled blob that passed §4.4 and was bridged per §9.4, but that local custody does **not** hold once delivery returns, MUST enter a bounded per-(spool, scope) **accounted set** — as MUST a blob the member pushed without custodying it (C-9.4-3). |
| **C-9.6-2** | An accounted id MUST be folded into the client's local scope digest and counted as held, and MUST NOT be pulled again.                                                            |
| **C-9.6-3** | An accounted id MUST be dropped as soon as a `list` for its scope no longer names it, and MUST NOT be folded in while the same id is also held in custody.                        |
| **C-9.6-4** | The accounted set MUST outlive a connection. Retaining it across a process restart is permitted, not required.                                                                    |

> **Why this exists.** §12.2 sets the scope TTL at 48 h against a 24 h mesh custody TTL *deliberately* —
> "longer retention stores frames the inner ratchet may no longer decrypt". That band is not an edge case,

> out of custody. Without C-9.6-2 those ids sit in the spool's digest and can never enter the client's:
> the scope reports diverged for the whole second day, `list` runs on every tick, and each pull re-bridges
> a message the inner ratchet has already consumed. This is §9.3's failure exactly — "folds into the
> spool's digest but never the client's: permanent divergence and infinite re-pull" — arriving through a
> door §9.3 does not cover, because these blobs are *valid*: they fail nothing in §4.4, they die at the
> custody store's own dead-on-arrival rule, which is downstream of the bridge and reports nothing back.
>
> **Why it is not the invalid set.** §9.3's entries are "never counted as held" because a spool that
> plants garbage must not be able to move our digest. These blobs are the opposite: they are frames we
> genuinely received, and counting them as held is what the digest needs to be *true*. Keeping the two
> sets apart also keeps §9.3's quarantine counter meaning what it says — spool misbehaviour, expected 0.
>
> **Why "custody did not keep it" rather than a TTL comparison.** The client already owns one copy of the

> the spool client would be a second thing to keep in step; asking the store what it did is exact by
> construction, and it covers quota eviction and any future refusal for free.
>
> **Why C-9.6-3.** Both halves are the same divergence mirrored. An accounted id the spool has since
> expired leaves the client's fold carrying something the spool no longer counts; an id that is both
> accounted and held would XOR its own contribution out of an XOR-folded digest and cancel itself.
>
> **Why C-9.6-4.** A connection-scoped set is not a fix: a client reconnects on Doze, a network change or

## 10. Security and privacy claims [Both]

### 10.1 What a spool, or whoever takes its disk, observes

- Opaque scope ids and their activity rhythm: sizes, timings, a long-lived pseudonymous channel per
  conversation era. §3's rotations bound the eras.
- Subscriber **IPs** and connection patterns. "These k IPs touch the same scope" is an edge between
  IPs
  and is the honest residual leak. **Tor removes it**, at battery and latency cost; a later
  milestone
  ships the toggle. Scope multiplexing over one WSS already blurs per-scope timing somewhat, and
  padding or cover traffic is future study (§11).
- For attachments, a **stronger size signal than frames give**: that a scope holds an object of
  roughly
  `total × 48 KiB`, when it was uploaded, and how many subscribers fetched it. Chunking quantises
  this to
  48 KiB and the keyed `aid` keeps the attachment unlinkable across scopes and unconfirmable against
  a
  candidate hash. Even so, "this conversation exchanged a ~4 MB image at 09:14" is visible in a
  way "this
  conversation exchanged some frames" is not. That is the price of carrying bytes at all, and it is
  why
  the byte quota is per scope.
- For a **pair scope** (§3.5), an id that is stable per pair rather than per session era — two
  bootstraps of the same pair, years apart, share it. Bounded by the subscription window: pending plus
  `pairGrace`, after which the scope is gone and the pair lives on its rotating DM scope.
- Where a member defers the §9.5 push half, a **proximity** signal on top of that: an upload that
  only
  happens once the radios stopped carrying the bytes tells a spool roughly when a conversation's
  members
  were apart. Frames stay unconditional (C-9.5-9) precisely so this does not generalise. It is
  scoped to
  the object class that already leaks a size and a time, and it buys not shipping a second copy of
  every
  photo that already crossed a radio link. A member that never defers gives up nothing here.

### 10.2 What it cannot do

- Read content, rosters or delivery facts, or map a scopeId to node ids. The KDFs are keyed by
  member
  secrets, receipts are indistinguishable sealed frames, and §4.3's keyed nonce denies the
  known-plaintext confirmation oracle.
- Forge or tamper: AEAD outside, the mesh's Ed25519 frame signature inside, verified byte-exact
  after
  unsealing.
- Replay usefully: content-addressed ids, idempotent delivery, the dead-on-arrival TTL.
- Withhold *undetectably* when the scope is multi-homed: members see spool divergence via digests.
- Screen content. `moderation` (§7.5) is a request a conforming client honours, not a check the
  spool can perform or verify.

### 10.3 Compromise horizons

### 10.4 Insider threats

Spam is bounded by the scope's own quotas. Key leakage is E2E's universal caveat. A departed group
member
watches old-scope ciphertext flow only until the departure re-mint rotates the id (§3.3), bounded by
the
drain window.

Scope ids and, in v1, SUB and PUSH are otherwise unauthenticated toward the spool: anyone who
*learns* a
scopeId can subscribe to its ciphertext and burn its quota. That is accepted in v1: ids are
unguessable
KDF outputs, and multi-homing plus rotation bound the damage. A TOFU scope-auth extension is
registered
in §11.

Non-normative. What the spec describes that runs today, and what is specified but not yet on the
wire.

The plane is **off by default** and gated behind a one-time consent disclosure. With it off, or with
no
spool configured, the client opens no socket at all. It is **reachable** in shipped builds from the
reference client's 2.4.0 (ADR 064) — 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 carried this implementation but hid every way into
it behind a build flag. Neither the wire nor any derivation differs between the two states.

## Appendix B. Change log

Non-normative. Wire compatibility is stated per entry: no entry has changed a spool record, a
derivation,
or a §13 vector. Two entries touch a *mesh* frame payload rather than this plane — 2026-08-19 adds a
field, 2026-08-23 stops populating one — both additively and without moving an existing golden vector;
the plane itself was unaffected either time, since a spool never decodes a frame.

| 2026-08-16 | **Group scopes (M4).** §3.2's v1 mint opened from the creator to any member, with preferred-minter-plus-grace damping, which also unfreezes a departure re-mint whose re-minter never comes back. Adoption gained two mandatory insider-DoS bounds (C-3.2-10, C-3.2-11). §4.4 pinned where a group frame's id actually lives                                                                                                                                                                                    | None for spools: a spool never sees a root                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2026-08-16 | **Attachments (M5).** §4.5, §6.5, §7.3 and §9.5 added as fresh sub-numbers, so no existing cross-reference moved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Spools only.** An attachment-capable spool advertises three new HELLO limits and answers five new records; one that does not omits them and is left alone                                        |
| 2026-08-17 | **Deferred attachment uploads (ADR 021).** §9.5's push half became a bounded MAY (C-9.5-5…9), priced in §10.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | None.

| 2026-08-17 | **Formalisation and accuracy pass.** Requirement identifiers throughout, rationale separated from normative text, Appendices A and B added. Corrected against the implementations: the DM frame rule's unset-group and ratchet-header conditions and the group rule's exclusion of v1-wrapped chat (§4.4); `groupupdate` group photos as a second attachment reference shape (§9.5); the deferral rule's per-recipient evidence requirement, which is what confines it to DM scopes (§9.5); §5's shipped status | None. No wire field, derivation or vector changed                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2026-08-19 | **Profiles cross the plane (ADR 022).** §4.4 admits `type = profile` into both scope forms — matched on sender alone in the DM half (C-4.4-5…7), on the founding roster in the group half (C-4.4-13). It is the only carrier of `ProfileContent.prekey`, so without it an Internet-only peer could never learn a rotated prekey, re-establish a broken DM session, or receive the group sender-key seeds that ride as ctl DMs                                                                                   | None for spools. Clients: profile blobs now fold into the scope digest, so a member on an older build quarantines them (C-9.3-1) and reports itself unconverged for that scope until it is updated |
| 2026-08-23 | **The attachment MIME leaves the mesh frame (ADR 035).** §9.5's reference table drops `attachmentMime` from the `chat` row; C-9.5-1 generalises to "a frame need not name a mime"; new C-9.5-10 says where a fetcher gets one instead. Client-side only — §4.3 seals the whole frame, so a spool never observed the field                                                                                                                                                                        | None for spools, and no record, derivation or §13 vector changed. Clients: tolerate a reference with no mime (already required for `groupupdate`) and resolve the type locally                     |
| 2026-08-24 | **Capacity refusal (§7.1).** New S-7.1-10 and C-7.1-11 write down what a spool at its connection cap does — refuse the upgrade `503` with `Retry-After`, never a close code — and what a client does about it                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Spools:** optional; a spool with no cap is unaffected. **Clients:** a refused upgrade is not a close code, so a client that reports only close codes shows a full spool as an unexplained transport error                     |
| 2026-08-25 | **Pair scopes (ADR 042).** New §3.5: a scope both members derive from their *identity* DH keys, so a pair that has only exchanged a contact card out of band (`docs/CONTACT_CARD.md`) can meet at a spool before a session exists. Carries the §4.4 DM frame set unchanged; subscribed only while an intro is pending plus a 48 h grace. §1.1/§1.4 wording, §3.4 row, §10.1 bullet, §10.3's identity-file row narrowed to *conversation* scopes, §12 constants, four §13 rows appended                                                                                                                                                                                              | None for spools: one more opaque id. Clients: a new label family under `knit/scope/v1/pair/…`; no record, no existing vector moved                                                                                                |
| 2026-08-30 | **The accounted set (ADR 062).** New §9.6: a pulled blob that passed §4.4, bridged, and that local custody did not keep is counted as held and never pulled again (C-9.6-1…4), with §12.2 gaining the set bound. Closes the divergence §9.3 was written for, arriving through the one door §9.3 does not cover — a *valid* blob in the 24–48 h band between the mesh custody TTL and the scope TTL, which no client could ever fold into its digest | None for spools. Clients: a scope that has been reporting `converged = false` for the back half of the spool's retention should now settle, and stop re-pulling that band on every reconnect |
| 2026-09-12 | **The commons (§7.4).** One shared scope per spool for a private relay's membership: the invite grammar, the two derivations (the spool's bare-hash id under the transport-plane prefix, the members' HKDF seal keys), the HELLO advertisement that never carries the id, pinned bounds, no creation gates, the non-striking spool-wide push budget, and the client half — a `profile`-plus-`commons` frame set, a post door that bypasses §9.4, bounded deferral of a post ahead of its author's profile, accounted-by-construction, the member's own profile kept live, single-spool affinity. §1.4 wording, §3.4 row, §12.2 defaults, five §13 derivation rows and two record vectors appended | **Spools:** optional; a spool with no commons omits the field and is unaffected. **Clients:** a new `commons` mesh frame type (non-custodial, additive) and a new label family under `knit/spool/v1/commons…`; no existing record, derivation or vector moved |
| 2026-09-13 | **Client hardening against a hostile spool (ADR 2026-09.amzn).** §9.3 gains C-9.3-3 (an invalid entry may go once unlisted) and C-9.3-4 (the event path never quarantines); §9.5 C-9.5-11 (an attachment quarantine may expire at the scope TTL); §9.1 C-9.1-3…5 (an over-long `list` is refused whole; a silent spool is dropped after consecutive unanswered requests; a refused scope is parked, not re-`sub`bed every tick); §12.2 rows for the three. All client-side | None for spools. Clients: none of it is observable on the wire beyond fewer records — no record, derivation or vector moved |
| 2026-09-14 | **The deferral's evidence names a plane (ADR 2026-09.xmte).** §9.5's non-normative reference-client paragraph: the ack half of the push-half deferral counts only a receipt that arrived over a short-range radio. Read plane-agnostically it deferred an upload on the strength of a receipt that had itself crossed the spool, so a peer already out of radio range waited out the sighting window. C-9.5-5…9 are unchanged — they never named a plane | None for spools. Clients: a member that defers less, which no spool can tell apart; no record, derivation or vector moved |
| 2026-09-12 | **Send-side moderation (§7.5).** One optional HELLO bool, `moderation`, by which an operator asks clients to run their on-device content screen before sending and to withhold what it flags, with no sender override; strictest wins across a multi-homed scope; receive-side behaviour untouched; no data-path change at the spool. §10.2 bullet, one §13 record vector appended | **Spools:** optional; a spool that does not set it omits the field and is unaffected. **Clients:** tolerate-and-ignore until the client half lands; no existing record, derivation or vector moved |
| 2026-09-13 | **The direct push (§9.4 C-9.4-3, ADR 2026-09.y5f3).** A member may push a frame it does not custody — today one class, a room post's `relay = false` delivery tick at its ride deadline — under the ordinary §4.4 rule, C-9.2-1 and the size bounds, and must account it per §9.6 (C-9.6-1 gains the second writer). Appendix A row for `ScopeSync.pushDirect`. All client-side | None for spools: a pushed blob is a pushed blob. Clients: none of it is observable on the wire — no record, derivation or vector moved |
| 2026-09-15 | **The deferral reads both ends, and not before an ack could exist (ADR 2026-09.p7j8).** §9.5's non-normative reference-client paragraph again: the evidence half is one fact read from whichever end of the DM the member is — the author's receipt over a radio, or the recipient's own arrival plane — and a missing ack counts for nothing until 60 s after the frame's `sentAt`, because a client that wakes on a local custody change asks first on the send itself. Without the first, a recipient re-uploaded every photo a radio had just handed it; without the second, the gate never fired at all. C-9.5-5…9 are unchanged | None for spools. Clients: a member that defers more, which no spool can tell apart; no record, derivation or vector moved |
| 2026-09-14 | **The relay invite link (§7.4 note, `docs/RELAY_INVITE.md`).** A non-normative pointer: the reference client mints and accepts the relay, its token and its commons secret as one `https://getknit.app/r#…` link, applied on one confirmation. Client-side only; the link never reaches a spool | None for spools. Daemons SHOULD print the link beside `knit-commons:v1:…`; no record, derivation or vector moved |
