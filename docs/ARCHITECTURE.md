# Knit — Architecture & Implementation Notes

Detailed design notes for the Knit mesh messenger. For build/contribution rules see
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md); for a user-facing overview see [`../README.md`](../README.md).

---

## 1. Overview

Knit is an offline, serverless proximity messenger. Each device is simultaneously a sender, a
receiver, and a relay. Messages flood across an ad-hoc mesh of nearby phones over **two radios at
once** — **Wi-Fi Aware (NAN)** and **Bluetooth LE** — hopping device-to-device so they can travel
beyond direct radio range. There is **no Google Nearby / Google Play services dependency**: the radios
are driven directly through the framework `android.net.wifi.aware.*` and `android.bluetooth.*` APIs,
composed behind one `MeshTransport` seam so everything above is radio-agnostic.

The app surfaces a **"Nearby" public broadcast room**, **1:1 direct messages**, and **multi-member
group chats**, with profiles (name / status / avatar), emoji **reactions**, **@-mentions**, and image
**attachments** (GIF/JPEG/PNG/WebP). DMs and group messages flood like broadcast traffic — only the
addressed recipient(s) deliver/ack them — but they are **end-to-end encrypted** (§14), so relays
carry ciphertext; the public Nearby room stays plaintext by design. A **store-and-forward** custody
layer makes delivery delay-tolerant (design detail in `.agents/context/store-and-forward.md`),
and on-device **content moderation** screens abusive text and explicit images
(`docs/CONTENT_MODERATION.md`). The wire format and identity layer still leave room for true
(targeted) routing without rework.

Design goals, in priority order: (1) correctness of the mesh (dedup, bounded propagation,
duplicate-suppressed flooding), (2) a clean transport abstraction so radios can be swapped or run
side-by-side, (3) a Signal-like Compose UI, and (4) reliable background operation.

## 2. Module / package map

The phone app is the Gradle module `:app`, package root `app.getknit.knit`. The Wear OS app is the opt-in
`:wear` module (in the build only under `-Pknit.wear=true`, ADR 2026-09.wetm): it shares the package name and
compiles `wearstatus/` from `:app`'s source, so that package imports nothing but `java.*` and `kotlin.*`.

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ui/` | Compose screens + ViewModels: `onboarding/`, `chatlist/` (conversation list), `chat/` (thread + `MentionText`), `contacts/` (new-DM picker), `search/` (app-wide search, ADR 2026-09.wnh6; the list rules it shares with `chatlist/` live in `ui/ConversationTitles.kt`), `profile/`, `group/` (details), `diagnostics/`, `blocked/`, `share/` + `invite/` (offline app share), `donate/`, shared `components/` (`Avatar`, `GroupAvatar`, `ConnectionStatus`), `image/` (Coil `BlobFetcher` / `QrCode`), `theme/`, `util/RelativeTime`, `KnitApp` (Navigation Compose), `Permissions.kt`, `Battery.kt` |
| `mesh/` | `MeshTransport` (interface) + `CompositeMeshTransport` (runs the two radios below at once), `MeshRouter` (dedup + jittered/suppressed flood), `MeshManager` (orchestrator), `MeshService` (foreground service), `MeshMetrics` (counters), `SeenSet`, `FakeLoopTransport` / `DemoTransport`, `BlobExchange` + `BlobStore` (content-addressed pull), `ForwardSync` + `ForwardStore` (store-and-forward custody), `KeyExchange` (`keyreq`) + `PendingInbound` (park-until-key), `StoreDigest` + `DigestTracker` (cue-plane anti-entropy), `power/`, `protocol/Wire.kt` |
| `mesh/crypto/` | End-to-end crypto (Google Tink), pure & JVM-testable: `MessageCrypto` (per-message seal/open; the frame signature is applied by `MeshManager`, §14), `PublicKeyBundle`, `MessageContent` (the encrypted payload), `AttachmentCrypto`, `SafetyNumber`, `VerifyPayload`, `Crypto.kt` (`TinkInit`/`AesGcm`) |
| `mesh/wifiaware/` | `WifiAwareTransport` — the **only** code that touches `android.net.wifi.aware.*` (the NAN plane) |
| `mesh/bluetooth/` | `BluetoothMeshTransport` (BLE advertise/scan presence + persistent L2CAP links) + its pure policies (`PromotionPolicy`, `ScanDemandPolicy`, `ConnectBackoffPolicy`, `BlePresenceTracker`) — the **only** code that touches `android.bluetooth.*` (the BLE plane) |
| `mesh/link/` | `LinkFraming` (transport-neutral socket record codec) + `FramedLink` / `LinkSocket` / `LinkHandshake` — shared by the NAN NDP socket and the BLE L2CAP socket |
| `moderation/` | On-device content moderation: `TextModerator` (`LexicalTextFilter` + `MlTextModerator`) + `ImageModerator` (`NsfwImageModerator`) + `SentencePieceTokenizer` — see `docs/CONTENT_MODERATION.md` |
| `data/` | Room (`KnitDatabase`, `message/` — incl. `MessageFtsEntity`, the FTS4 index over bodies (ADR 2026-09.wdfz) —, `peer/`, `reaction/`, `blob/`, `group/`, `forward/`), `search/` (`SearchQuery` + `Snippets`, the pure half of search), repositories (`MessageRepository`, `PeerRepository`, `ReactionRepository`, `GroupRepository`, `BlobRepository`, `forward/ForwardRepository`), `AttachmentStore`, `AvatarStore`, `settings/SettingsStore` (DataStore), `crypto/` (`DatabaseKey`, `IdentityKeyStore`, `KeystoreSecret` — AndroidKeyStore-wrapped secrets) |
| `identity/` | `Identity` (stable node id **+ E2E public-key bundle**), `NodeId` (derivation), `DeviceIdSource` (`AndroidDeviceIdSource`), `DeviceTag`, `Alias` (deterministic display-name fallback) |
| `notifications/` | `Notifier` (interface) + `MessageNotifier`, `NotificationChannels`, `NotificationHistory`, `NotificationActionReceiver` |
| `crash/` | Manual crash reporting (ADR 028): `CrashHandler` (uncaught-exception capture, installed before Koin so startup crashes are caught), `CrashStore` (five reports under `noBackupFilesDir`), `CrashRedactor` (structural at capture, contact names on read), `CrashReports` (reader + share staging), `CrashIssueUrl` (prefilled GitHub bug form). No upload path — the user hands the report over |
| `location/` | "Send location" (ADR 2026-09.tss4): `GeoUri` (the `geo:` token a message body carries — format, strict parse, strip, describe; pure), `LocationFix` + `LocationFixPolicy` (which reading to keep, the refine window; pure), `LocationSource` (seam), `AndroidLocationSource` — the **only** code that touches `android.location.*`, listening only while the composer's staged tile collects it |
| `wearstatus/`, `mesh/wear/`, `mesh/bluetooth/wear/` | The mesh status a paired Wear OS watch reads (ADR 2026-09.wetm): `WearStatusCodec` (the 20-byte snapshot: state, counts, and a radio mask per drawn peer, never an id) and `WearStatusFrame`, both compiled into `:wear` too; `WearStatusSource` (computes it from the flows the app's own screens read); `WearStatusServer` (a secure RFCOMM socket first, a read-only encrypted GATT characteristic as the fallback, bonded devices only). Dark in release behind `BuildConfig.WEAR_STATUS` |
| `di/` | Koin modules: `appModule`, `meshModule`, `moderationModule`, `uiModule` |

### Data flow

     └────────── MeshRouter ◀── (dedup + jittered relay) ◀── MeshTransport.inbound ◀──────────────────────────-┘
```

`MeshManager` is a Koin singleton shared by the foreground service and the UI, so both observe and
drive the same mesh instance. Avatars and attachments travel **out of band as file payloads**, not
inside frames (see §3.1, §7).

## 3. Mesh layer

### 3.1 Transport abstraction (`mesh/MeshTransport.kt`)

```kotlin
interface MeshTransport {
    val neighbors: StateFlow<Set<Peer>>       // live data-path links right now (routing target)
    val reachable: StateFlow<Set<Peer>>       // smoothed "who's nearby" for the UI (coordination plane)
    val health: StateFlow<TransportHealth>    // Healthy / Degraded (radio seized) / Unavailable (off)
    val inbound: Flow<InboundFrame>           // frames received (pre dedup/relay)
    val incomingFiles: Flow<ReceivedFile>     // completed file transfers (avatars + attachments)
    val incomingDigests: Flow<ReceivedDigest> // store-and-forward id-lists (data-path anti-entropy)
    fun start(); fun stop(); fun heal()       // heal() = rescan/reconnect now
    suspend fun send(wire: WireEnvelope, to: Peer? = null)   // null = broadcast to all neighbors
    fun fastFanout(wire: WireEnvelope)                       // coordination-plane blast, no data path
    fun fastSend(wire: WireEnvelope, to: Peer)               // coordination-plane point-to-point
    suspend fun sendFile(file: File, to: Peer, meta: FileMeta): Boolean  // false = no live route (caller's re-offer retries)
    suspend fun sendDigest(to: Peer, ids: List<String>)      // advertise held custody ids on link-up
    fun expectBulkTransfer(nodeId: String): Boolean          // arm an on-demand data path for an imminent big blob
    // + kind / hasFastPlane / highThroughput / radioContended and the cross-plane hints suppressDataPath() / onForeignReachable()
}
```

Supporting types are declared in the same file: `Peer(nodeId, protoVersion, capabilities)` carries the
advertised (unauthenticated) routing hint; `InboundFrame` carries the verbatim `WireEnvelope` plus its
already-decoded `RelayEnvelope` (so the router and delivery paths don't each re-decode); `FileMeta` /
`ReceivedFile` route a completed transfer by `FileKind` — an **AVATAR** (`key` = sender node id) updates
that peer's avatar, an **ATTACHMENT** (`key` = content hash) feeds the blob-exchange pull (§7); and
`ReceivedDigest` carries a neighbor's held custody id-list. `send` takes a `WireEnvelope` (the frozen
on-radio unit, §4); the two `fast*` methods are the best-effort **coordination-plane** path that reaches
neighbors with no data path (§3.2) and no-op on a transport without one.

Implementations:

- **`WifiAwareTransport`** — the Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) plane: a coordination plane (Aware messages) plus one
  ephemeral NDP data path; see §3.2.
- **`BluetoothMeshTransport`** — the Bluetooth LE plane: BLE advertise/scan presence plus several
  persistent L2CAP links; see §3.2.1.
- **`CompositeMeshTransport`** — runs the two radio planes **simultaneously** behind this one interface
  (merging `neighbors`/`reachable`/`health`/`inbound` by nodeId, preferring Bluetooth for sends), so
  `MeshManager`/`MeshRouter` stay radio-agnostic. DI (`di/MeshModule.kt`) gates each child on hardware
  support, so a device with only one radio runs that plane alone. One deliberate exception to the
  Bluetooth-first rule: **ATTACHMENTs prefer the `highThroughput` plane** (a NAN NDP moves megabytes in
  under a second vs. L2CAP's seconds-to-minutes) — any size rides a live NAN link if one exists, and one
  ≥ 128 KiB (`BULK_MIN_BYTES`, compared against the **transcoded wire blob**, not the picked file — a
  multi-MB GIF lands at ~150-250 KB as a 480px animated WebP) additionally arms an on-demand bring-up
  via `expectBulkTransfer` and grace-waits ≤ 10 s (off the inbound dispatch coroutine) before falling
  back to Bluetooth. Every decision logs a `file route: …` line under the `CompositeMeshTransport` tag.
  See the AGENTS.md gotcha for why a plain routing preference is not enough (steady-state digest parity +
  BLE suppression) and why the bulk mark must stay out of the NAN recovery machinery.
- **`FakeLoopTransport`** / **`DemoTransport`** — in-process doubles for JVM tests and the demo build;
  `FakeLoopTransport.connect()` wires instances into an arbitrary topology so a multi-hop mesh (relay,
  blob pulls, custody) runs on the JVM with no radios.

### 3.2 Wi-Fi Aware specifics (`mesh/wifiaware/WifiAwareTransport.kt`)

- **Service `SERVICE_NAME = "_knitmesh1._tcp"`.** Each node `attach()`es once, then both
  **publishes and subscribes** the service. The device's **node id + version + caps**
  (`Protocol.advertise`) ride in the publish `serviceSpecificInfo`, so a subscriber learns a peer's
  identity on discovery with zero round-trips and rejects discovering itself. `SERVICE_NAME` is the
  transport marker: any breaking change to the cue or socket format (or the node-id derivation) bumps the
  `knitmesh<N>` digit — a **hard cut** (old and new builds simply don't discover each other). The
  coordination-plane compact/fragment/transcoded message tags (`0x03`/`0x04`/`0x05`,
  `mesh/link/FastFrameCodec`, `mesh/link/FrameTranscoder`) are the deliberate counter-example: additive and
  capability-gated (`CAP_FAST_COMPACT`, `CAP_FRAME_TRANSCODE`), so they ride *without* a marker bump. *(Pre-1.0
  alpha churned through the markers `.v2`…`.v8`, recorded in `docs/DIGEST_PULL_REATTACH.md`; that history
  is collapsed into the v1 launch baseline.)*
- **One data interface → two planes.** Real chipsets (Pixel 7/8/9) report `maxNdiInterfaces == 1`, and
  each aware *network* needs its own NDI — so a node holds at most one **outbound** (initiator) NDP, and
  cannot mix roles concurrently. (The **accept-any responder** is one network that can officially serve
  **many concurrent inbound NDPs** on the same NDI — on-device-verified 2026-07-04; the shipped transport
  still serializes serves by choice, and the concurrent-serve redesign is proposed in
  `docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md`.) So the transport does **not** try to link everyone — it runs two
  planes (the deep treatment, including the NDI-wedge root cause, is in `AGENTS.md` and
  `docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md`):
  - **Coordination plane** — Wi-Fi Aware *messages* (`DiscoverySession.sendMessage`, ~255 B, best-effort)
    ride discovery follow-up frames and need **no data path**, so they reach every neighbor at once and
    keep working while the one NDP is busy. Each node cues `nodeId|version`, a `StoreDigest` content
    digest of its custody set (XOR of held frame ids — incremental and restart-stable); `DigestTracker`
    flags a peer *sync-wanted* when either side's digest changed since the last sync. Small floodable
    frames also ride this plane as a best-effort **fast fan-out** (`fastFanout`/`fastSend`), deduped by the
    receiver's `SeenSet`, so they propagate with zero NDP. This is the `hasFastPlane` path
    `CompositeMeshTransport` routes the fast methods to.
  - **Data plane** — one ephemeral NDP (a TCP socket over link-local IPv6), brought up **only** for a
    sync-wanted peer (the larger nodeId initiates; the smaller serves an **accept-any responder** anchored
    to its publish session, because per-peer responders don't compose — one already serving a peer can't
    stand up a second). On link-up each side advertises the custody ids it holds (a
    `LinkFraming.Type.DIGEST` record) and pushes back only the frames the peer lacks, then tears the NDP
    down on quiescence — freeing the interface for the next pair. An idle mesh does **zero** data-path work.
- **Accept-any responder handshake.** Since the responder accepts a data path from any initiator, the
  **initiator sends its advert as the first `LinkFraming.Type.HELLO` record** (`mesh/link/LinkHandshake`,
  shared with BLE) so the responder learns who connected. A fixed app-wide 32-byte PMK (`setPmk` — skips
  the per-NDP passphrase→PMK derivation; same public-constant security) encrypts the link; real
  authentication is the per-frame signature + E2E layer above. Instant Communication Mode (API 33, when
  supported) speeds discovery + data-path bring-up for the brief-encounter (festival) case.
- **Neighbor vs. reachable.** `neighbors` is the ≤1 live NDP link — the routing target for `send` /
  `sendFile` and the "new neighbor" (store-and-forward / key-exchange) hooks — and it **flaps** as
  ephemeral syncs come and go, so the **UI reads the smoothed `reachable` set** (coordination-plane
  sightings, lingered `REACHABLE_LINGER_MS`) instead.
- **Lifecycle hardening.** A time-boxed client `requestNetwork` (`HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS`) + per-peer
  backoff, a single-flight / generation-guarded `reattach()`, an idempotent responder, and a
  process-restart `checkWedge` watchdog keep the single NDI off the "no interfaces available" wedge (the
  full lifecycle is in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/DIGEST_PULL_REATTACH.md`; the framework root cause of both
  wedges — a 0-NDP TERMINATING request the framework never reaps — plus the ghost-proof fix is in
  `docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md` §2).
  `ACTION_WIFI_AWARE_STATE_CHANGED` drives `health` (→ `Degraded` when Wi-Fi is off or another Wi-Fi mode
  seizes the radio) and re-attach on recovery. A device without `FEATURE_WIFI_AWARE` runs the Bluetooth
  plane instead (§3.2.1); only a device with **neither** radio is "unsupported".
- **Socket framing (`mesh/link/LinkFraming.kt`).** Transport-neutral — the same codec runs over the NAN
  NDP socket and the BLE L2CAP socket. A byte stream is chunked into length-prefixed records
  `[type:1][len:4 big-endian][payload]`: `FRAME` (one CBOR `WireEnvelope` → `inbound`); a file as
  `FILE_HEADER` (JSON `FileHeaderWire`: kind + key + mime + the stream's `size`, a label the receiver's
  progress ring reads, ADR 2026-10.y9qh, and — when the stream is the rest of a cut transfer — the `offset` it
  starts at, ADR 2026-10.wtyc) → `FILE_CHUNK`s → `FILE_END` (→
  `incomingFiles`); `DIGEST` (a custody id-list, at most one waiting per link — a newer one takes the
  waiting one's place, ADR 2026-09.tjfb); plus `HELLO`/`KEEPALIVE`. The writer serializes files
  and interleaves live frames *between* chunks so an 8 MiB blob never stalls traffic; a per-file receive
  ceiling matches the 8 MiB send cap.
- **Byte metrics:** `send` records `metrics.onBytesSent(bytes.size * targets.size)` — one frame
  broadcast to N neighbors counts as `frameSize × N`, so the CBOR win is measurable in the field.
  (`sendFile` is not counted.)

### 3.2.1 Bluetooth LE specifics (`mesh/bluetooth/BluetoothMeshTransport.kt`)

The BLE plane runs **simultaneously** with Wi-Fi Aware behind `CompositeMeshTransport`, and is
**preferred** for sends (persistent, cheap links vs. NAN's one ephemeral NDP). Unlike NAN it can hold
**many** links at once, so it needs no single-slot cue dance; it is also the mesh plane for phones with
no Wi-Fi Aware hardware.

- **Presence** — connectable BLE advertising of a fixed 24-byte service-data payload
  (`BleAdvertPayload`: capabilities, the nodeId's raw 16 bytes, digest cue, L2CAP PSM, a BLE-local flags
  byte) under a versioned
  16-bit service UUID (`BleConstants.SERVICE_UUID`, bumped on every breaking wire change to hard-partition
  at discovery; the layout/version is implied by the UUID, so there is no format-version byte). The advert
  carries **only** the service-data AD — no separate service-UUID-list AD — so the 16 raw id bytes still
  fit the 31-byte legacy budget; the scan filters on the presence of service data for the UUID. That
  duty-cycled scan feeds `BlePresenceTracker` (per-peer smoothed RSSI + continuous-presence dwell +
  last-seen linger), which drives the `reachable` set. Advertising is always-on so BLE-only devices still
  discover us.
- **Data links** — persistent **L2CAP CoC** sockets; `BluetoothSocketLink` adapts the socket to the same
  `LinkSocket` / `FramedLink` / `LinkFraming` machinery NAN uses, so framing, files, and the `DIGEST`
  id-diff are shared. `PromotionPolicy` (pure) decides which nearby peers to hold a link to (dwell + RSSI,
  bounded by a connection budget, hysteretic weakest-first eviction); `ConnectBackoffPolicy` (pure) backs
  off repeated per-peer connect failures.
- **Adaptive scan** — `ScanDemandPolicy` (pure) duty-cycles the scan by *demand*: a settled clique floors
  the scan (~2 min) while an isolated node scans aggressively. NAN acts as an early-warning — via
  `CompositeMeshTransport.onForeignReachable`, BLE boosts its scan to chase a peer another plane already
  sees onto the cheaper persistent link. `BluetoothAudioMonitor` flags A2DP-audio contention
  (diagnostic-only today; the connect-time gate is deferred — §18).
- **Side channel** (`BleSideChannel`, ADR 2026-09.sjaa; `BuildConfig.BLE_SIDE_PLANE`, debug-only until its
  device trial) — the BLE analogue of NAN's fast fan-out: small floodable frames on non-connectable
  extended-advertising pages (one `FastFrameCodec` unit per page, ≤ 236 B, under a second service UUID),
  connectionless so they bypass a blob head-of-line-blocking the L2CAP stream and reach a sighted-but-unlinked
  peer. `SideCarousel` schedules two advertising sets (12 s dwell, fewer-part frames first, typing coalesced);
  `SideScanPolicy` runs the second, filtered scan only while a peer advertising the flags byte is around.
  The transport declares `hasFastPlane`: `fastFanout` keeps the link copy and adds the page; `fastSend` never
  uses a page.

### 3.3 Routing, dedup & duplicate-suppressed flooding (`mesh/MeshRouter.kt`, `mesh/SeenSet.kt`)

`MeshRouter` is transport-agnostic and unit-tested (`FakeLoopTransport` / a fake). It does **not**
blind-flood. On each inbound frame `handleInbound`:

1. **`SeenSet.add(id)`** — if this is the **first sighting** of the frame id, deliver locally via the
   `onDeliver` callback (persist / ack / react / cache), then **schedule** a relay.
2. If it's a **duplicate** (already seen), it is never re-delivered or re-relayed — but it *is*
   evidence the frame is already propagating, so it's counted toward **overhear suppression**
   (`metrics.onDeduped()` + `countOverheard`).

**Jittered relay with overhear suppression** replaces immediate rebroadcast (which storms a dense
cluster with O(neighbors²) redundant sends):

- `scheduleRelay` keeps the synchronous early-outs — a frame flagged **not to relay** (`relay = false`,
  e.g. a `blobreq`) and a **TTL-exhausted** frame (`hops >= ttl`) are dropped immediately. Otherwise it
  records a `PendingRelay { relayed = wire.relayed(), heardFrom, job }`
  in a `Mutex`-guarded `pending` map keyed by frame id, and launches a coroutine that waits a small
  random **`jitter()`** delay, then re-checks under the lock and, if still pending, sends the
  hop-incremented frame to every neighbor **not** in `heardFrom` (split-horizon across every source
  it heard the frame from, not just the first).
- `countOverheard` adds the duplicate's source to `heardFrom`; once the frame has been heard from
  **`suppressThreshold`** *distinct* neighbors (default 2 — i.e. one *other* node was heard relaying it),
  the pending relay is **removed and its job cancelled** (cancel happens outside the lock), and
  `metrics.onSuppressed()` fires. This is classic counter-based gossip: redundant rebroadcasts are
  cut in dense meshes while sparse meshes (where no duplicate is overheard) still relay reliably. A
  second copy from the **same** neighbor is deliberately not an overhear: a link-up pushes a peer's
  profile live and the custody digest exchange that follows re-serves the same frame from the same
  peer moments later, and counting that copy used to cancel the relay that carries a newcomer's
  profile past the first hop (a node two hops away then waited for the 60 s custody re-offer).
- Tunables are constructor params with defaults: `jitterWindowMs = 150`
  (`jitter = { Random.nextLong(jitterWindowMs) }`) and `suppressThreshold = 2`. The `jitter` lambda
  is an injection seam so tests use a fixed delay and virtual time. `metrics` is also injected
  (defaulted) so the same params keep existing call sites source-compatible.
- **Self-originated frames bypass suppression.** `originate()` / `sendOwn()` mark the frame seen and
  send immediately; the echo that returns from the mesh hits the duplicate branch and is a harmless
  no-op.
- `stop()` cancels any relays still waiting out their jitter window and clears the map; it's called
  from `MeshManager.stop()` so coroutines don't linger on the app-lifetime scope. The map is
  otherwise self-draining (an entry is removed on fire or suppress) and transitively bounded by the
  `SeenSet`.

`SeenSet` is a **bounded, time-windowed LRU** (`maxSize` eviction + `ttlMillis` expiry, injectable
clock). Combined with the per-frame TTL/hop-count, propagation is guaranteed to terminate.

### 3.4 Transmission metrics (`mesh/MeshMetrics.kt`)

A pure-JVM, thread-safe counter set (`AtomicLong`s; no Android deps, so it lives in `mesh/` and is
asserted from the same unit tests as `MeshRouter`). It is a Koin singleton injected into both
`WifiAwareTransport` and (via `MeshManager`) `MeshRouter`. Counters: `framesOriginated`,
`framesDelivered`, `framesRelayed`, `framesSuppressed`, `framesDeduped`, `bytesSent` — plus a
`DropReason` breakdown and the key-exchange / pending-inbound recovery counters
(`keyRequestsSent`/`keysServed`/`keysRecovered`, `framesHeld`/`framesReplayed`) surfaced in the
Diagnostics screen; `snapshot()` returns an immutable `Snapshot`. `MeshManager.logMetricsPeriodically()` logs a snapshot every
`60_000 ms`. The `framesSuppressed : framesRelayed` ratio quantifies how much rebroadcasting the
overhear suppression eliminated; `bytesSent` tracks the CBOR byte win.

### 3.5 Orchestration (`mesh/MeshManager.kt`)

Owns the transport + router + `BlobExchange` + `ForwardSync` + `KeyExchange` + `PendingInbound`, and
implements `onDeliver`, the router's per-frame callback. It first runs `verifyInbound` (§14: a byte-exact
Ed25519 check of `WireEnvelope.sig`, drop-but-still-relay on failure; a `NO_SENDER_KEY` drop parks the
frame in `PendingInbound` and asks `KeyExchange` for the sender's profile), then dispatches on the
cleartext `RelayEnvelope.type` **string** (a discriminator, not a sealed subtype — §4) and its decoded
per-type content:

- **`chat`** → blocked-sender drop (local surfacing only — the frame is still carried and relayed, ADR 010).
  A **group** message (`group != null`) reconciles the self-describing roster and delivers if we're a
  member; a **DM** addressed to someone else (`!Conversations.isForMe(...)`)
  is only relayed + carried (don't persist/notify/ack). For a DM/group meant for us the `ChatContent.enc`
  envelope is **decrypted** (`decryptAndDeliver`; dropped on any failure, and never throwing — §14) before
  persisting to Room (unacked), screening the body/image on-device (`docs/CONTENT_MODERATION.md`), pulling
  any referenced attachment blob, notifying (mention vs. normal — §11), and acking (§5). The broadcast
  room is plaintext.
- **`groupupdate`** → reconcile the stored group from the carried roster (e.g. a rename), no message
  persisted. **`groupleave`** → apply the member's leave tombstone.
- **`profile`** → upsert the peer's name/status/avatar (last-writer-wins on `sentAt`) and **pin its E2E
  key** trust-on-first-use into `PeerEntity.pubKey` (a changed key resets `verified` — §14), merging so an
  unfetched avatar isn't clobbered; then **replay** any frames `PendingInbound` parked for that sender.
- **`receipt`** → `markReceived(ackId)` (gated to the DM's `recipientId`) drives the ✓ tick and purges the
  carried DM copy mesh-wide (`ForwardSync.onAck`). This is the **legacy cleartext form** — between
  ratchet-capable builds a receipt is a sealed `CTL_RECEIPT` ctl chat frame instead, which flips the tick
  without purging anywhere (ADR 018, §14): delivered DMs then age out of custody on the TTL uniformly.
  A DM's receipt floods and is custodied either way; a **broadcast/group** receipt starts as a unicast,
  non-flooded tick the deliverer owes the author (`AckSync`, sealed once + resent verbatim for capable
  authors), and a **group** tick toward an absent capable author escalates: the acks batch and one sealed
  ctl frame (`MessageContent.acks`) is originated `relay = true` — flooded, custodied, spool-eligible —
  so the ✓✓ converges like the message it acks (ADR 033). One surviving receipt flips it ("≥1 received");
  `onAck` no-ops for it (no single recipient), so retries never evict custody.
- **`reaction`** → `ReactionRepository.apply(...)` (last-writer-wins, §6). Also the legacy cleartext form:
  DM/group-target reactions between capable builds ride sealed (`CTL_REACTION`, DM or group form) into
  the same table under the same LWW clock, so mixed-form races converge (ADR 018).
- **`blobreq`** → `BlobExchange.onRequest(...)` (serve the blob or recurse the pull, §7). **`keyreq`** →
  `KeyExchange` re-serves the requested peer's profile verbatim or records the asker and recurses (the
  inbound key-recovery path — see `.agents/context/store-and-forward.md`).

Every custodial frame is also persisted for store-and-forward (`ForwardSync`, `FrameType.isCustodial`).
Also: `sendChat` (broadcast / DM / group, with optional attachment + mentions — **encrypts** for DM/group,
§14; screens abusive text/images before sending), `sendReaction`, `sendGroupUpdate` / `sendGroupLeave`,
profile broadcasting with **content-hash-gated avatar dedup** (§8), `heal()`/`restart()`, the periodic
metrics log, and `neighborCount`/`reachable` `StateFlow`s for the UI.

## 4. Wire protocol (`mesh/protocol/Wire.kt`)

The on-radio format is **layered binary CBOR**, structured so it can evolve *additively* — the
authoritative rules live in **`docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`** (read it before touching any wire type) and the
"Wire format" bullet in `AGENTS.md`. Three layers, one CBOR config (`encodeDefaults = false`,
`ignoreUnknownKeys = true`):

```kotlin
// L1 — the frozen on-radio unit; the ONLY thing a relay re-encodes (ttl/hops only).
class WireEnvelope(ttl = DEFAULT_TTL /*8*/, hops = 0, relay = true,
                   @ByteString sig, @ByteString signed)   // relayed() rewrites ttl/hops; sig+signed pass byte-for-byte

// L2 — what `signed` decodes to: cleartext routing fields + an opaque per-type payload.
class RelayEnvelope(type: String, id, senderId, sentAt, recipientId?, group?, @ByteString payload)

// L3 — per-type content inside `payload` (only endpoints parse it):
data class ChatContent(body="", mentions, attachmentHash?, attachmentMime?, enc?)     // enc = EncEnvelope for a DM/group
                                                                                     // (a sealed frame sets attachmentHash only — ADR 035)
data class ProfileContent(name, status, avatarHash?, pubKey?, deviceTag?, protoVersion?, capabilities?, prekey?, version?,
                          openToChat = false)                                    // the flag is elided while off
data class ReactionContent(messageId, emoji?)  ·  ReceiptContent(ackId)  ·  GroupLeaveContent(groupId)
data class BlobReqContent(hash, offset?)  ·  KeyReqContent(nodeIds)               // a groupupdate carries its GroupInfo in `group`

data class Mention(nodeId, name)                                    // canonical id + rendered @name span
data class GroupInfo(id, name?, members, createdBy, photoHash?, photoUpdatedAt?)   // self-describing roster on every group frame
class EncEnvelope(v=1, @ByteString nonce, @ByteString ct, keys, r?, g?)  // E2E envelope; keys = v1 wraps; v2: r = DM ratchet header, g = group sender-key header
class WrappedKey(to, @ByteString wk)                               // content key wrapped to one recipient
```

- **One signature, opaque blobs.** `sig`/`signed`/`payload` are `@ByteString ByteArray` — never nested
  `@Serializable` objects — so a relay forwards `signed`+`sig` verbatim (`WireEnvelope.relayed()` touches
  only `ttl`/`hops`) and the originator's Ed25519 signature over `signed` survives every hop. This is *not*
  kotlinx sealed polymorphism: `type` is a plain **string**, so an old build decodes (and still relays) a
  `type` it doesn't understand instead of throwing. `WireEnvelope.sig` is the *single* signature
  authenticating every flooded type (§14).
- **`id`** is the globally-unique dedup key; **`ttl`** (`DEFAULT_TTL = 8`) + **`hops`** bound propagation
  and live in the unsigned `WireEnvelope` (the only in-flight-mutable fields — the signature covers
  neither). The router relays a frame it can't verify verbatim rather than black-holing it; `blobreq`
  (with `relay = false`) is the point-to-point exception, handled hop-by-hop by `BlobExchange` (§7).
- **A `reaction`** carries a fresh random `id` per emit (not derived from message/sender/emoji) so the
  dedup `SeenSet` doesn't swallow a later retract/replace; convergence is `sentAt`'s job (last-writer-wins),
  not the id's. `emoji = null` is a retraction.
- **Addressing & encryption:** `RelayEnvelope.recipientId` (null = broadcast/group; set = the addressed DM
  recipient) and `RelayEnvelope.group` (non-null = a group message; carries the self-describing `GroupInfo`
  roster) stay **cleartext** so relays and store-and-forward carriers can route/reconcile. For DMs and
  groups the body, mentions, and attachment refs are encrypted into `ChatContent.enc` (the `EncEnvelope`);
  the cleartext `body`/`mentions` are blank, while `attachmentHash` carries the *ciphertext*
  hash so a blind carrier can still custody the image (§7, §14). `attachmentMime` stays null on a sealed
  frame (ADR 035) — custody addresses bytes by hash, so the type rides only inside the seal and a carrier
  never learns a photo from a voice note. A file's **name and size** ride inside the seal for the same
  reason and never got a cleartext counterpart: a filename is a louder signal than the type ADR 035 removed
  (ADR 2026-09.qq2r). `ProfileContent.pubKey` carries the
  sender's public-key bundle. See §14.
- Avatars and attachments travel as **file payloads** (`incomingFiles`), not inside frames (too large for
  the flood); `ProfileContent.avatarHash` / `ChatContent.attachmentHash` let a peer detect changes and pull
  by content hash.

### `WireCodec` — CBOR

`WireCodec` round-trips each layer to/from bytes — `encodeWire`/`decodeWire` for the outer
`WireEnvelope`, `encodeEnvelope`/`decodeEnvelope` for the signed `RelayEnvelope`, and
`encodePayload`/`decodePayload<T>` for a per-type content — and every `decode*` returns null on malformed
input. It uses **CBOR, not JSON**, configured `encodeDefaults = false` and `ignoreUnknownKeys = true`:

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalSerializationApi::class)
object WireCodec {
    val cbor = Cbor { ignoreUnknownKeys = true; encodeDefaults = false }
    fun encodeWire(wire: WireEnvelope): ByteArray = cbor.encodeToByteArray(wire)
    fun decodeWire(bytes: ByteArray): WireEnvelope? = runCatching { cbor.decodeFromByteArray<WireEnvelope>(bytes) }.getOrNull()
    // …encodeEnvelope/decodeEnvelope (RelayEnvelope) · encodePayload/decodePayload<T> (per-type content)
}
```

CBOR encodes numbers as binary and length-prefixes strings (no quotes/braces/field-name text per
value), and `encodeDefaults = false` omits defaulted `ttl`/`hops`, empty collections, and null reserved
fields — stripping the framing bytes a JSON frame used to carry. Because each layer is an opaque
`@ByteString` blob rather than one polymorphic tree, a relay re-encodes **only** the `WireEnvelope`
wrapper (`ttl`/`hops`) and passes `signed`+`sig` byte-for-byte, so additive fields and new `type`s no
longer force a coordinated break.

> **What is (and isn't) a wire break.** Adding a nullable/defaulted field or a new `type` string is
> **additive** and safe across builds. A **break** — renaming/re-typing/repurposing a field or `type`,
> changing the `WireCodec` config or the signed input, or the `SERVICE_NAME`/`SERVICE_UUID` markers — is a
> coordinated one-time event (bump the transport marker + DB version). See `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.

## 5. Conversations & direct messages (`data/message/Conversations.kt`)

A pure-Kotlin object (JVM-testable) that defines the conversation namespace:

- **`const val NEARBY = "nearby"`** — the single public broadcast room (shown as "Nearby").
- **`idFor(senderId, recipientId?, selfId)`** — `recipientId == null → NEARBY`; otherwise the DM is
  keyed by the *other* party (a DM I sent is keyed by its recipient, a DM I received by its sender).
- **`isForMe(recipientId?, selfId)`** — `recipientId == null` (broadcast, everyone) or
  `recipientId == selfId` (a DM addressed to me). A node merely relaying someone else's DM gets
  `false` and must not persist/notify/ack it.

DMs still **flood** (no routing table yet): `MeshManager.sendChat` sets `recipientId` and originates
the frame to the whole mesh exactly like broadcast; only the addressed recipient delivers and acks,
and a DM's receipt floods back (the recipient is the only one who acks). The chat list shows the
always-present Nearby room plus one row per DM thread; the contacts picker starts a new DM.

## 6. Reactions (`data/reaction/`, `data/ReactionRepository.kt`)

- **Schema** — table `reactions`, composite **PK `(messageId, reactorNodeId)`** (at most one
  reaction per person per message), columns `emoji: String?` and `updatedAt: Long`, indexed on
  `messageId`, **no FK** to `messages` (a reaction may arrive before its target message and must
  persist as an orphan that the UI later joins).
- **Last-writer-wins** — `ReactionRepository.apply(...)` upserts only if the incoming `updatedAt` is
  strictly newer than the stored clock for that (message, reactor); equal/older frames (duplicates,
  out-of-order add/retract/replace) are dropped. `emoji = null` is a **retraction tombstone** row —
  a null at a newer clock must still beat a stale "add", which a DELETE couldn't.
- **UI** — `observeReactions()` exposes a flat flow of non-tombstone rows; `ChatViewModel` groups by
  `messageId` then `emoji` into a `ReactionSummary(emoji, count, mine)` per message. `sendReaction`
  toggles (tapping your current emoji retracts; a different one replaces) and floods a
  `reaction` frame.

## 7. Attachments & content-addressed blob exchange (`data/AttachmentStore.kt`, `mesh/BlobExchange.kt`)

Attachments — images, voice notes and arbitrary files — are **content-addressed** and pulled on demand, so
the (large) bytes don't ride the flood. Everything below the ingest seam is content-type-blind: it moves
opaque SHA-256-addressed bytes with a MIME string beside them, which is why voice notes (ADR 034) and files
(ADR 2026-09.qq2r) each shipped as two ends and no middle.

- **`AttachmentStore`** — `ingest(uri)` returns `IngestResult.Success(Ingested(hash, mime), flagged)`
  or `IngestResult.Failed(reason)`: GIFs are transcoded to animated WebP (`data/webp/WebpTranscode`, animation
  preserved); other images are EXIF-oriented, downscaled to `MAX_DIMENSION = 1280`, and re-encoded
  JPEG q85; inputs are rejected if empty or `> MAX_BYTES` (8 MiB). `ingestVoice(bytes)` and `ingestFile(uri)`
  share the tail and skip the head — nothing to decode or re-compress, and no classifier that could read
  them — with one deliberate exception: `ingestFile` sniffs the bytes' own signature and hands anything that
  is really an image back to `ingest`, so a mislabelled JPEG cannot use the MIME-keyed screening skip as a
  way past the classifier (`docs/CONTENT_MODERATION.md` §7). A file also carries its **name** and plaintext
  **size** on the `Ingested`, the two facts a file bubble cannot read off the bytes; both are written to the
  row and sealed into `MessageContent` by `MeshManager.sendChat`, never onto the cleartext frame. The
  **SHA-256** of the stored bytes
  is the hash, and the bytes live in the encrypted `blobs` table, not as files — only in-flight
  transfers touch the disk, through the `blobtx` cache dir. A received file leaves only through the storage
  picker (`ChatViewModel.saveAttachmentTo` streams the decrypted bytes into the destination the user names);
  there is no "open with", because that would need a plaintext copy ADR 029 refuses to make. `MeshBlobStore.saveIncoming(hash, mime,
  srcPath)` ingests a received file and **re-verifies** that the bytes hash to the peer-supplied
  address before storing it, since a holder must not be able to serve arbitrary bytes under someone
  else's content address.
- **`BlobExchange`** (with the `BlobStore` interface `has`/`fileFor`/`mimeFor`/`saveIncoming`,
  adapted over `AttachmentStore`) implements a hop-by-hop pull:
  - `want(hash)` — returns early if held, already in flight (`fetching` set), or already **arriving**
    on a link (`MeshTransport.arrivingFiles()`: a `FILE_HEADER` in, no `FILE_END` yet — read off
    `FramedLink.rxFile`, never a memo; the same read gives the chat its progress ring, ADR 2026-10.y9qh);
    otherwise sends a `blobreq` frame (`relay = false`) to **every
    direct neighbor**.
  - `onRequest(hash, fromNodeId, offset)` — if we hold the blob, send it straight back over the file channel
    (`FileKind.ATTACHMENT`) — from the asker's `offset` when it kept the start of a cut transfer (ADR
    2026-10.wtyc) — unless a copy is already queued or streaming to that peer
    (`MeshTransport.fileInFlightTo`) or was enqueued inside the per-(hash, peer) **serve memo** (45 s,
    un-stamped if the enqueue is refused). If not, **recurse** by calling `want(hash)` on the asker's
    behalf, and remember nothing about the asker (ADR 2026-09.4tx5): the asker re-asks on its own 60 s
    tick while it still lacks the bytes, and only it can tell whether they are already on the way.
  - **Resume (ADR 2026-10.wtyc).** A link closed mid-stream hands an attachment's prefix to `PartialBlobs`
    (session-scoped, keep-the-longer); every ask names its length as the `blobreq` `offset`; the receiving
    link's `FileIntake` splices the holder's tail onto a copy of it. A spliced file that fails the store's hash
    check drops the prefix and is asked for from byte 0 at once.
  - `onReceived(...)` — save the blob, clear `fetching`, fire `onObtained`
    (`MessageRepository.setAttachmentPath`, filling the local path on every message referencing the
    hash). Nothing is pushed to anyone: a blob walks hop-by-hop over direct-neighbor file transfers,
    one hop per re-ask.
  - `onNeighborAdded(peer)` re-asks a neighbor for everything still missing and not arriving — on a new
    link (catches late joiners) and on the 60 s re-offer tick for every linked neighbor, re-armed from the
    database first (`MeshManager.rewantMissingBlobs`, ADR 2026-09.ptv8).
  - **Storm/loop control:** the `fetching` dedup set, the non-relaying request frame (`relay = false`,
    never flooded — each hop mints a fresh request id), and never bouncing a blob back to its giver.

On startup, `MeshManager.resumePendingFetches()` re-requests any attachment referenced by a stored
message whose bytes aren't present yet (`MessageDao.hashesNeedingFetch()`) — and any
attachment referenced by a **carried store-and-forward frame** whose bytes are missing
(`ForwardStore.attachmentHashesNeedingFetch()`, gated by the carrier budget below), so a carrier keeps
retrying the image it is custodying for a late joiner.

**Over the Internet.** The same image crosses the spool plane as a second object class beside frames:
sealed and chunked under the scope keys, stored against a per-scope byte quota, and fetched on demand
from the cleartext hash the frame already carries (`docs/SPOOL_PROTOCOL.md` §4.5/§9.5,
`mesh/spool/ScopeAttachments`). It reuses this section's whole local half — the bytes land in `blobs`
and fire the same `onObtained` hook a radio pull does, so screening, the message row, and the UI are
unchanged.

**Blob custody.** Store-and-forward carries the *frame* but historically not the image bytes,
so a custodied message re-served to a late joiner — after the sender and every recipient who pulled it
have left — referenced an image no reachable node held (a permanent "Loading photo" spinner; for E2E
DMs/groups the carrier couldn't even see the sealed hash). Now a node that *carries* a chat frame also
eager-pulls its blob (`ForwardSync`'s `onCarried` hook → `MeshManager.onCarriedFrame` →
`BlobExchange.want`) and holds it, pinned against GC by the `forward_store` reference
(`BlobDao.orphanHashes` / `BlobRepository.deleteIfUnreferenced`) for the frame's carried lifetime — so
the bytes gain the same delay-tolerance as the frame. For E2E frames the (ciphertext) hash now rides in
cleartext (§14 / `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`) so a carrier blind to the sealed content can see it; the carrier
holds ciphertext it can't decrypt or screen (the addressed recipient screens on decrypt). The extra
"carrier-only" footprint — blobs referenced by a carried frame but no local `messages` row — is bounded
by a pull-time byte budget (`MeshManager.CARRIER_BLOB_BUDGET_BYTES`, `BlobDao.carrierOnlyBlobBytes()`);
because these blobs are deliberately **not** folded into the custody content digest (`StoreDigest`, §3.1),
that budget is a purely local knob that can differ per node without breaking cue-plane convergence.

## 8. Mentions (`mesh/protocol/Wire.kt`, `data/message/MentionStore`, `ui/chat/MentionText.kt`)

- **Detection** — `List<Mention>.mention(nodeId)` matches on **node id**, never name; a mention of
  *me* routes to the dedicated Mentions notification path (§11).
- **Highlighting** — `MentionText.highlightMentions(body, mentions, spanStyle)` builds `@name`
  tokens, sorts them **longest-first** (so `@Jay` can't grab a prefix of `@Jaylene`), and styles each
  non-overlapping occurrence via a per-char mask. The same file provides compose-time typeahead
  (`activeMentionQuery` / `filterCandidates`, which matches a candidate's name **or alias**); `ChatViewModel`
  builds the candidate list from the thread's senders ∪ the group roster (so @-mentions work in a fresh
  group before anyone has spoken).
- **Same-named people** (ADR 058) — the token the picker inserts is the candidate's collision-aware label
  (`PeerLabel.text`): `@Alice` normally, `@Alice (ReallyJoyfulFerret)` when the sender knows two Alices, and
  `Mention.name` carries that exact text so the receiver (and every older build) still locates the span.
  The picker row always shows the alias beside the name.
- **Storage** — `object MentionStore` (in `MessageEntity.kt`, its own lenient `Json`) encodes
  mentions to a JSON array string for the `messages.mentions` TEXT column (default `"[]"`); a
  malformed/legacy value decodes to an empty list rather than crashing rendering.

## 9. Data layer (`data/`)

- **Room** (`KnitDatabase`, `knit.db`) — **encrypted at rest with SQLCipher**: the passphrase is a
  random key wrapped under a hardware AndroidKeyStore key by `data/crypto/DatabaseKey`. **DB v1 is the
  frozen launch baseline**, with **no** destructive fallback: from v1 forward every schema bump ships a
  tested `Migration` in `KnitMigrations` (validated by `KnitDatabaseMigrationTest`) — a missing one makes
  Room throw at open time (caught in CI) instead of silently wiping a user's messages/custody/pins.
  The schema JSON is exported to `app/schemas/` and checked in per version. Seven tables:
  - `messages`: `id` (PK, wire id), `senderId`, `recipientId?`, `conversationId` (default `NEARBY`,
    indexed), `body` (the **decrypted plaintext**, held only inside the encrypted DB), `sentAt`,
    `received`, `arrivedAt?` (**our** clock when an inbound row was first persisted — the local
    complement of the author's `sentAt`, so the details screen can show the store-and-forward latency;
    null on our own sends and on every row older than DB v7, never rewritten by a custody re-serve),
    `mentions` (JSON, default `"[]"`), `attachmentHash?`, `attachmentMime?`,
    `attachmentKey?` (base64 AES key for an E2E attachment; null for plaintext/broadcast attachments),
    `attachmentName?` / `attachmentSize?` (an arbitrary **file**'s own name and declared byte count, both
    off the seal — null on images and voice notes, which describe themselves; the name is what selects the
    file bubble, and the size is a pre-arrival label the stored blob's length supersedes),
    `moderation` (on-device content verdict), `pendingKey` (composed before the recipient's key was
    known; not yet flooded — §14), `kind` (normal vs. a member-left system row). No DAO read returns a
    whole table or a whole thread: the chat screen reads a newest-anchored window
    (`observeNewestForConversation`, ADR 2026-09.hd5n) and the list screens read per-thread summaries
    (`observeNewestPerConversation`, `observeDistinctConversations`, `observeGroupSenders`,
    `countUnreadIn`), all served by the two `conversationId`-led indices; plus `markReceived`,
    `deleteByConversation`, and `hashesNeedingFetch`.
  - `peers`: `nodeId` (PK), `name`, `status`, `avatarHash?`, `pubKey?` (pinned E2E public-key bundle),
    `verified` (out-of-band key confirmation, see §14), `deviceTag?` (key-independent block-list
    continuity), `protoVersion?` / `capabilities?` (advertised, diagnostic), `updatedAt`, `openToChat` (their
    declared availability, ADR 2026-09.74fq).
  - `reactions`: composite PK `(messageId, reactorNodeId)`, `emoji?`, `updatedAt` (see §6).
  - `blobs`: `hash` (PK, SHA-256), `mime`, `bytes` — content-addressed attachment bytes (avatars, images,
    voice notes, arbitrary files); E2E-attachment bytes are stored as **ciphertext**, addressed by their
    ciphertext hash.
  - `blob_verdicts`: `hash` (PK), `flagged`, `score` — the on-device NSFW image verdict cached by content
    hash, so identical bytes are scanned once across send/receive (`docs/CONTENT_MODERATION.md`).
  - `groups`: `groupId` (PK), `name`, `members` (JSON roster), `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `nameUpdatedAt`,
    `left` (leave tombstone), `departed` (JSON set of members who left), `photoHash?` / `photoUpdatedAt` (the
    decided photo, advertised and last-writer-wins) and `photoShownHash?` (the photo that renders, once its
    bytes are local and screened — ADR 2026-09.nxcq).
  - `forward_store`: `id` (PK), `recipientId?`, `groupId?`, `senderId`, `type`, `origin`, `signed`, `sig`,
    `sentAt`, `receivedAt`, `expiresAt`, `attachmentHash?` — the encrypted store-and-forward custody set
    (immutable signed frames re-served to newcomers; the id set the cue-plane content digest folds over —
    §3.2, `AGENTS.md`).
- **Repositories** (`MessageRepository`, `PeerRepository`, `ReactionRepository`, `GroupRepository`,
  `BlobRepository`, `ForwardRepository`) are the single source of truth; DAOs expose `Flow<List<…>>` for
  the UI and suspend writes for the manager.
- **`SettingsStore`** (Preferences DataStore, `knit_settings`): node id, display name, status,
  advertising/discovery toggles, `avatarUpdatedAt`, and a last-read watermark driving unread badges.
  **Generates and persists the node id** on first read (`getOrCreateNodeId`, transaction-guarded
  against races; §10).
- **`AttachmentStore`** (§7) — ingests images, voice notes and arbitrary files into the content-addressed,
  encrypted `blobs` table (keyed by SHA-256). For E2E DM/group attachments the bytes are encrypted first and keyed by their
  ciphertext hash (§14); broadcast-room attachments are stored plaintext-in-the-encrypted-DB.
- **`AvatarStore`**: own avatar picked → center-cropped square → 256² JPEG q90, stored in the
  encrypted `blobs` table (peer avatars likewise, pulled over the mesh). `ownAvatarHash()` is a
  **SHA-256 of the avatar bytes** (stable across devices and unaffected by a no-op rewrite —
  meaningful enough to gate re-pushes, unlike the old length+mtime fingerprint).

## 10. Identity & profiles

- **`Identity.nodeId()`** resolves (and caches) the stable **128-bit node id** — the *self-certifying*
  hash of the device's E2E public-key bundle. `NodeId.derive(seed)` = the first **16 bytes** of
  `SHA-256("knit-node-id-v2:" + seed)`, RFC4648-**base32**-encoded (lowercase, unpadded) to a 26-char
  `[a-z2-7]` string, where `seed` is `Identity.publicKeyBundle()` (the base64 bundle) — **not** a
  platform device id. Because the id is derived from the keypair, a peer can only claim an id it holds
  the private key for (forging a colliding bundle is a 128-bit second-preimage), which is what makes the
  TOFU key pin race-proof and the ~41-bit predecessor did not — this was widened as a coordinated wire
  break during pre-1.0 alpha (folded into the v1 launch baseline). base32 keeps the id
  filesystem/delimiter-safe so it stays disjoint from the `g-…` group-id namespace and rides avatar
  filenames / the verify payload. The device's long-term **E2E keypair** lives in
  `data/crypto/IdentityKeyStore` **outside** the DB (so the id is stable for the
  life of that keypair; an app-data wipe that drops `identity.key` mints a new identity); its public
  bundle is exposed via `Identity.publicKeyBundle()` and advertised in `ProfileContent.pubKey` (§14).
- **`Alias`** (ADR 2026-09.wuqj) maps any node id to a deterministic PascalCase "AdverbAdjectiveNoun"
  token (e.g. `ReallyJoyfulFerret`): `SHA-256("knit-alias-v2:" + nodeId)`, each byte a whole index into
  one of three frozen 256-entry lists (`AliasWords.kt`, pinned by a fingerprint test), three bytes to a
  token and ten tokens in the digest — every device derives the same friendly name for a peer with no
  exchange. `displayNameFor(storedName, nodeId)` returns the non-blank profile name else the alias, so a
  peer is never shown as a raw id.
- **`PeerLabels`** (ADR 058, growth rule ADR 2026-09.wuqj) — names are not unique, so a list surface
  resolves through `PeerLabelIndex.labelFor` instead: over the universe of every cached peer ∪ our own name,
  grouped by `NameKey` (NFKC, format chars stripped, lower-cased, whitespace collapsed), a peer whose name
  another identity shares is labelled `Name (Alias)`; a label that still reads like another's (a blank-named
  peer whose alias someone chose as a name, a name chosen to look like a label, an alias ground to match)
  grows by the next token of the phrase, round by round, so labels are distinct by construction.
  `PeerRepository.observeDirectory()` emits the table with its index; `labelIndex()` is the suspend snapshot
  (notifications, card preview). Collision-evident, not anti-impersonation — a 24-bit token is minutes of
  grinding, but a match can only make both labels longer, never equal; `verified` and the safety number
  remain the trust mechanism.
- **Profile broadcasting** (`MeshManager`):
  - On a **new neighbor**, push the current profile frame and (only if needed — §8) the avatar file.
  - On a **profile change** (name/status/avatar, observed via a combined settings flow, `.drop(1)` to
    skip the initial value), bump `profileVersion` to the wall clock, re-broadcast the frame, and
    send the avatar to neighbors **that don't already have this exact avatar**.
  - The profile frame id is `profile-<nodeId>-<profileVersion>`, so an unchanged profile re-sent on
    connect dedups everywhere except the new peer, while a changed profile re-floods.
  - **Avatar re-push dedup:** a `sentAvatarHashes: ConcurrentHashMap<nodeId, hash>` records the last
    avatar hash sent to each neighbor; `sendAvatarIfNeeded` skips the (large) JPEG when the hash is
    unchanged, so editing just your status text no longer re-ships your avatar to everyone. A
    departed peer's entry is cleared in `watchNeighbors`, so a genuine reconnect re-sends once.

## 11. Notifications (`notifications/`)

- **`Notifier`** interface — `createChannel`, `notify`, `notifyMention`, `setChatVisible`, `clear`,
  `onDismissed`. `NotificationChannels` registers the channels per context: `knit_msg_nearby`
  (`IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT` — the busy broadcast room), plus `knit_msg_dms`, `knit_msg_groups_v2`, and a
  dedicated `knit_msg_mentions` (all `IMPORTANCE_HIGH`); separate app channels are the foreground-service
  `knit_mesh` (`IMPORTANCE_MIN`), `knit_alerts` (`IMPORTANCE_LOW`), and `knit_open_to_chat`
  (`IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT`) for the presence cue below.
- **The "open to chat" cue** (`presence/`): a profile flag (`ProfileContent.openToChat`, carried on both
  profile paths, stored as `PeerEntity.openToChat`) plus one standalone notification — "Sam is nearby and open
  to chat" / "3 people nearby are open to chat" — that opens the Nearby room. `OpenToChatWatch` (started by
  `MeshManager.start`) joins the own flag, the short-range `neighbors` set, the peer rows carrying the flag,
  the block list and the people already messaged; the pure `OpenToChatPolicy` batches newcomers for 20 s,
  re-cues a person only per encounter (out of range ≥ 15 min, ≥ 2 h since their last cue, ≤ 2 cues a day),
  and posts at most once an hour overall, holding later arrivals for the next post. Its per-person stamps and
  the last post time persist in `SettingsStore` so a restart cannot re-buzz. The cue is an **introduction**,
  so anyone already met drops out of it entirely (ADR 2026-09.3yje): `MessageDao.observeAcquaintedPeers`
  reads the two-way exchanges out of `messages` — a DM thread with a message each way, or a group both have
  posted in — and the Nearby room and status notices never count.
- **Room/DM notifications** use `NotificationCompat.MessagingStyle` so multiple senders show in one
  grouped notification; `NotificationHistory` keeps the last ~8 `NotifMessage`s for that context, and
  each becomes a `Person`-attributed line with the sender's cached avatar.
- **Mentions** branch to a separate, standalone `BigTextStyle` notification on the Mentions channel
  (a message that `@`-mentions you takes `notifyMention`, everything else `notifyIncoming` — they're
  mutually exclusive), so a direct ping isn't buried among other senders.
- `setChatVisible`/`clear` suppress and dismiss notifications while you're reading; a
  `NotificationActionReceiver` wired as the `deleteIntent` calls `onDismissed` so a swipe-away clears
  accumulated state without those messages reappearing.

## 12. UI layer (`ui/`)

- **Compose + Material 3, Navigation Compose.** `KnitApp` hosts a `NavHost` with routes
  `onboarding`, `chatlist`, `contacts`, `settings`, `profile`, and `chat/{conversationId}` (the conversation id
  is the Nearby room, a peer node id, or a `g-…` group id; it defaults to `Conversations.NEARBY`), plus
  group details, diagnostics, blocked-users, donate, and an offline app-share flow. Start destination is
  `chatlist` if the radio permissions are granted, else `onboarding`. `MeshService` is started by a
  `LaunchedEffect` once the user is past onboarding.
- **Screens:**
  - `OnboardingScreen` — a three-page stepper (ADR 2026-09.nzpr): welcome (brand mark + how it works), an
    optional display name (a live `Avatar` preview of the initial peers will see, keyed on the node id, over the
    shared `DisplayNameField`; stored via `SettingsStore.setDisplayName` on leaving the page), and permissions as one row per concept with live state — the radio set gates
    Start, while notifications (33+) and the battery exemption are optional rows that can also point at
    app-info Settings once Android stops showing the dialog. `onboardingSeen` opens a returning phone (a
    grant revoked later) on the permissions page directly.
  - `ChatListScreen` — one row per conversation (always-present Nearby room + DM threads with
    messages), each with a leading visual (room icon vs. peer `Avatar`), last-message preview,
    relative time, and an unread `Badge`; a FAB opens Contacts, an overflow menu opens Settings.
  - `ContactsScreen` — the new-DM picker; lists your contacts by the shared `contactIds` rule (accepted
    DM peers, explicitly accepted peers, co-members of accepted groups, verified peers − self and blocked),
    online-first; one pick opens `chat/{nodeId}`, several create a group. A contact is removed from their
    `ProfileDetailsScreen` overflow (ADR 2026-09.adgd).
  - `ChatScreen` — a `LazyColumn` of bubbles with reactions, image attachments (Coil + animated
    decoder for GIF/WebP), `@`-mention highlighting and typeahead, auto-scroll, and an IME-padded
    input.
  - `SettingsScreen` — what the overflow menu opens: a profile header row into `ProfileScreen`, the
    light/dark selector, the content-filtering / Material You / link-preview switches, the rows that hand
    off to the Internet-relay and LoRa screens, and the battery-opt row.
  - `ProfileScreen` — your own profile behind that header row: avatar via photo picker + Coil,
    name/status fields, node id, alias, and the open-to-chat flag, with one Save for the two text
    fields; key verification (safety number / QR) of a *peer* is `ProfileDetailsScreen`.
  - **Also:** `GroupDetailsScreen` (roster / rename / photo / leave), `DiagnosticsScreen` (transport
    health, per-radio Bluetooth/Wi-Fi-Aware status, mesh metrics + store-and-forward digest),
    `BlockedUsersScreen`, `DonateScreen`, and a `ShareTargetScreen` / invite flow that shares the APK
    (and shared content) to a nearby phone offline.
- **ViewModels** (`ChatViewModel`, `ChatListViewModel`, `ContactsViewModel`, `ProfileViewModel`) are
  Koin `koinViewModel()`s. `ChatViewModel` takes the `conversationId` as a runtime parameter and
  `combine`s the conversation's messages (pre-merged with reactions), peers, neighbor count, node id,
  and display name into UI rows (mentions, attachments, reaction summaries, sender name/avatar).
- **Theme** (`ui/theme/`): real M3 light/dark schemes from the brand coral, with every role the
  dynamic scheme fills set explicitly (`ColorSchemeTest` guards that). Material You is a Settings
  switch, off by default so the brand shows; `KnitSemanticColors.positive` keeps "online / verified /
  healthy" green in every scheme, since a wallpaper-derived `tertiary` could land on the error hue.
  Light/dark is a Settings selector too, but it is applied as the platform's **per-app night mode**
  (`NightMode`/`AndroidNightMode`, API 31+) rather than passed to `KnitTheme`, so the launch window,
  `isSystemInDarkTheme()` and the system bars all follow one configuration; ADR 2026-09.v5ck.
- **Editable fields use write-through local state**, not the DataStore flow directly (see §15).
- **Coil 3** is configured app-wide in `KnitApplication` with the `AnimatedImageDecoder` so message
  GIFs/WebP animate.

## 13. Background survival (`mesh/MeshService.kt`)

A typed foreground service hosts `MeshManager` so the mesh survives backgrounding — `connectedDevice`, plus
`location` on API 29–32 where Wi-Fi Aware discovery is gated on the foreground-only location app-op
(`meshForegroundServiceTypes`, tiered with `requiredRadioPermissions`; ADR 2026-09.535d):

- **Foreground notification** (`knit_mesh` channel, `IMPORTANCE_MIN`) with Pause 15 min / Pause 1 hour / Stop
  actions; while paused it reads "Knit mesh is paused — Until 3:15 PM" with Resume / Stop.
- **Pause** (ADR 2026-09.wz99): the service stays foreground and takes `MeshManager` down until a wall-clock
  deadline held in `SettingsStore.meshPausedUntil`, which the service, the chat list's banner and the debug
  bridge all read through `MeshPause.activeDeadline`. `applyPause` converges idempotently on the key, so the
  notification's buttons, the banner's Resume (a store write alone) and a service created mid-pause all end
  where the store says. Two inexact resume alarms (`setAndAllowWhileIdle` + a 10-min `setWindow`, both
  `ACTION_RESUME`) plus an expiry check on every start bring it back; no exact-alarm permission.
- **Stop is sticky:** `SettingsStore.meshEnabled` is the user's switch, and every starter honours it —
  `BootReceiver` after a reboot, and `KnitApp`'s route and resume effects through `shouldStartMeshFromUi`
  (`ui/MeshStartPolicy.kt`, deciding on a fresh store read — a lifecycle-collected copy is stale on the
  resume after a Stop). The chat list's "Mesh stopped — Start" banner writes the flag back and the route
  effect does the start.
- **Heartbeat:** inexact ~15-min `AlarmManager` alarm → `ACTION_HEAL` → `MeshManager.heal()`.
- **Significant motion:** a `TriggerEventListener` (re-armed after each fire) → `heal()` (moving
  likely means new peers in range).
- **Radio availability** (Wi-Fi Aware turning on/off, or another Wi-Fi mode seizing it) is handled
  inside `WifiAwareTransport` itself via `ACTION_WIFI_AWARE_STATE_CHANGED`, not here.
- All cleaned up in `onDestroy` (including `MeshManager.stop()`, which cancels pending relays). The
  message notification channels are registered up front in `KnitApplication` so they appear in system
  settings before the first notification. Battery optimization is surfaced in onboarding and the
  settings screen (`ui/Battery.kt`).

## 14. Encryption posture

**Two layers.** (1) *In transit:* the Wi-Fi Aware NDP is encrypted with a fixed app-wide PSK. Every build
ships the same one, so it is a public constant: it defeats casual capture, not an eavesdropper who has read
the APK. The Bluetooth LE L2CAP CoC is **not** encrypted: `BluetoothMeshTransport` opens it insecure
(`listenUsingInsecureL2capChannel` / `createInsecureL2capChannel`), with no pairing, so room posts and every
frame's routing fields are readable over the air. On both planes a frame is authenticated by its Ed25519
signature, with two unsigned exceptions: the v3 `relay = false` delivery tick, which only its addressee can
authenticate, by opening it (ADR 059), and the blob request, which asks for a content hash.
(2) *End-to-end:* DM and group messages are encrypted to their recipients so relays — which flood every
message hop-by-hop — only ever carry ciphertext. *At rest:* the Room DB is encrypted with SQLCipher (§9). The
public **broadcast room is plaintext by design** (no fixed recipient set), so a room message takes the
unencrypted path (it is still signed, and store-and-forward-carried).

**Library.** Google **Tink** (`tink-android`) — HPKE/X25519 hybrid encryption, Ed25519 signatures,
and AES-GCM. Originally chosen because the then-`minSdk 29` predated the platform `XDH`/`Ed25519` JCA
algorithms (API 33+); `minSdk` is 29 (the BLE co-plane lowered it back from the NAN-era 33), so Tink stays — it's a
pure-runtime dep (no Gradle plugin) that can't perturb the bleeding-edge toolchain, and there's no
reason to re-implement working, audited crypto against the platform APIs.

**Identity keys** (`data/crypto/IdentityKeyStore`). Each device generates a Tink **hybrid** keypair
(wraps content keys) and an **Ed25519** keypair (signs) on first run. The private keysets are
serialized, AES-256-GCM-wrapped under a hardware AndroidKeyStore key (`KeystoreSecret`), and stored in
`filesDir/identity.key` — deliberately **outside** the DB, so the identity survives anything that
takes `knit.db` down (otherwise such an event would mint a new key and break pinning + stored
ciphertext). The public bundle (`PublicKeyBundle`, base64) is advertised in `ProfileContent.pubKey`.
The same file also holds the rotating **ratchet signed prekeys** (v2 DM bootstrap, below), so
in-flight session initiations survive a DB loss too.

**DMs — the epoch-rekey ratchet (crypto scheme v2, `EncEnvelope.v = 2`).** DMs between
ratchet-capable builds are forward-secret: an X3DH-style bootstrap off the peer's published signed
prekey establishes a per-pair session, and per-epoch X25519 rekeying + a forward-only message-key
chain bound the exposure of any later key compromise to the epoch retention window. The full scheme —
keys, derivations, epoch advance rules, races/replacement/reset, and the honest security claim — is
specified in `docs/FORWARD_SECRECY_RATCHET.md`; the implementation is `mesh/crypto/ratchet/`
(pure engine + session service) with state in the `ratchet_*` tables. Outbound v2 is gated on the
peer's pinned profile advertising `CAP_RATCHET` plus a prekey; anything else falls back to v1.

**Groups — the sender-key ratchet (crypto scheme v2, group form).** Groups whose every member is
ratchet-capable are forward-secret too (the group form shares `EncEnvelope.v = 2` with the DM
ratchet — both landed in one never-released bump; a group frame carries `g`, a DM `r`): each member mints a random per-group epoch
seed driving a forward-only chain, distributes it pairwise inside v2 ctl DMs
(`MessageContent.ctl = CTL_GROUP_KEY`), and seals group frames under a tiny `GroupRatchetHeader {se, n}`
with no per-member wraps. Recovery (lost seeds, late members, wipes) is the seed outbox + proactive
re-sends + a rate-limited key-request loop; a member's departure forces a rekey to the remaining
members (eventual, bounded by the signed `groupleave`'s convergence). All-or-nothing per message: any
non-capable member demotes that message to v1. Full scheme: `docs/GROUP_FORWARD_SECRECY.md` (ADR 017);
implementation `GroupRatchetEngine`/`GroupRatchetSessions` with state in the `group_*` tables.

**Receipts and reactions — sealed ctl frames (crypto scheme v2 addition).** Delivery receipts and
reactions toward ratchet-capable targets ride as `MessageContent.ctl` control frames
(`CTL_RECEIPT`/`CTL_REACTION`) inside ordinary v2 CHAT frames — wire-indistinguishable from
conversation, never persisted/notified/acked as messages, falling back to the legacy cleartext
frames for pre-ratchet targets (never to v1: an old build would strip the unknown ctl and persist an
empty bubble) and staying cleartext in the broadcast room by design. Sealed receipts retire the
carrier vaccine-purge — nobody can parse them, so delivered DMs age out of custody on the 24 h TTL
uniformly (the recipient custodies its own inbound DMs, and a cleartext ack self-vaccinates; both
keep ADR 006's digests convergent). Full scheme: `docs/ENCRYPTED_RECEIPTS_REACTIONS.md` (ADR 018).

**Per-message scheme v1** (static keys — the fallback: pre-ratchet peers, mixed-capability groups), in `mesh/crypto`:

1. Generate a random content key; AES-256-GCM-encrypt the `MessageContent` (body + mentions +
   attachment refs) into `EncEnvelope.ct`.
2. Wrap the content key (Tink hybrid) to **each recipient** — the DM's recipient, or a group's members
   minus self (rosters are capped at 8) — producing one `WrappedKey` each.
3. Put the `EncEnvelope` (nonce, ciphertext, wrapped keys) in `ChatContent.enc`. The envelope is **not**
   signed here: the AEAD AAD binds the message header (`id|sender|sentAt|thread`), and the *single frame
   signature* — `WireEnvelope.sig`, raw Ed25519 over the whole `RelayEnvelope` `signed` bytes (§4) —
   covers the encrypted `ChatContent`, so a wrapped key or ciphertext can't be replayed into another
   message.
4. Originate a `chat` frame with `ChatContent.enc` set, `recipientId`/`group` in the clear (for routing),
   and cleartext `body`/`mentions`/`attachment*` blank. The sender also stores its own **plaintext** copy
   locally.

On receive, `verifyInbound` (the gate at the top of `onDeliver`) has **already** checked
`WireEnvelope.sig` byte-exact against the sender's **pinned** key — for a `profile` frame, against the
`pubKey` in its own payload, since first contact precedes any pin — so after the for-me / group-membership
gate the recipient only unwraps its `WrappedKey`, decrypts, and delivers the plaintext. `MessageCrypto.open`
now just unwraps + AES-decrypts; there is no separate envelope signature. **Decryption/verification failures
must never throw out of the inbound handler** — `onDeliver` runs *before* the router schedules the relay,
so a throw would stop the device forwarding the frame; the crypto calls return null on any failure and the
message is dropped while relaying continues (`MeshManager.decryptAndDeliver`).

**Attachments.** Image bytes are encrypted to a per-attachment key and **content-addressed by their
ciphertext hash**, so the content-addressed pull/dedup (`BlobExchange`/`BlobStore`, §7) is unchanged —
relays serve opaque ciphertext. The key rides inside the encrypted `MessageContent` and is persisted
in `MessageEntity.attachmentKey` so the UI's Coil `BlobFetcher` can decrypt on display. So does the
**MIME type** since ADR 035 — the cleartext frame names the hash alone, and `MessageEntity.attachmentMime`
is written from the decrypted content. The residual is the blob transfer itself: `FileHeaderWire` still
names a mime to whichever neighbour pulls the bytes.

**Trust & verification.** Peer keys are pinned **trust-on-first-use** into `PeerEntity.pubKey`; if a
peer's advertised key later changes, it's adopted (so comms continue) but `PeerEntity.verified` is
reset and the change is flagged. Users confirm a key out of band on the peer's profile screen — comparing the
`SafetyNumber` (a Signal-style fingerprint derived symmetrically from both identities) or scanning the
peer's identity **QR** (`VerifyPayload` + ZXing) — which sets `verified` and shows a badge.

**Availability edge cases.** Sending requires the recipient's key: a DM composed before the recipient's
key is known is saved `pendingKey` and re-sealed + flooded once the key arrives (`flushPendingFor`); for
a v1-fallback group, members whose key is unknown are still skipped (the residual key-gap — §18); a ratcheted
group heals through the seed outbox + key-request loop instead (`docs/GROUP_FORWARD_SECRECY.md` §7).
An inbound frame from a not-yet-pinned sender is dropped locally but **parked** in `PendingInbound` and
recovered by a signed, point-to-point `keyreq` to neighbors (`KeyExchange`), then replayed once the
profile arrives (§3.5 / `AGENTS.md`). In practice profiles flood on connect, so keys are usually present
before the first message.

## 15. Build & tooling decisions

The project runs on intentionally bleeding-edge tooling — a current AGP / Gradle / Kotlin / Compose line
and an early `compileSdk`. The pins themselves live in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and the reasoning behind
each in `.agents/context/toolchain.md`; what follows is the *shape* of the constraints, which outlives any
particular version. Consequences, all load-bearing:

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Koin, not Hilt** | Hilt's Gradle plugin is broken on AGP 9.x (dagger#5083/#5099). Koin has no Gradle plugin / no annotation processor → immune. |
| **Built-in Kotlin overridden past AGP's bundled KGP** | AGP ships a KGP older than the Kotlin we compile with, and the older compiler can't read the newer one's class metadata. The root `build.gradle.kts` puts our KGP on the buildscript classpath (`classpath(libs.kotlin.gradle.plugin)`) so built-in Kotlin compiles with it. **Bumping AGP does not move Kotlin** — that classpath entry is the only lever; check Google's AGP/Kotlin matrix for the AGP floor the Kotlin line needs. It's also why **Coil tracks latest**: its old pin was a stale-metadata workaround that no longer applies. |
| **No `disallowKotlinSourceSets` override** | The `=false` escape hatch was dropped 2026-09-08. KSP2 registers its generated sources through AGP's sources API, not `kotlin.sourceSets`, so the flag bought nothing — and AGP 10 enforces it regardless. |
| **No `kotlin-android` plugin** | AGP's built-in Kotlin compiles Kotlin; only the compose / serialization / ksp plugins are applied. |
| **KSP on its own version line** | KSP adopted independent (KSP2) versioning at 2.3.0 — decoupled from the compiler, Kotlin 2.2+ — so one KSP version spans Kotlin releases instead of the old `<kotlin>-<ksp>` lockstep scheme. |
| **CBOR on the JSON BOM line** | `kotlinx-serialization-cbor` shares the version ref with the JSON artifact, so it's built with the same (toolchain-safe) Kotlin — no separate bump to vet. |
| **LiteRT / SQLCipher / Tink** | The on-device ML runtime (`com.google.ai.edge.litert`), at-rest DB encryption, and E2E crypto are Java + native `.so` with **no Kotlin metadata and no Gradle plugin**, so they can't perturb the pinned Kotlin graph — per-dep rationale is in the version catalog. LiteRT's pin is *separately* load-bearing for F-Droid and for 16 KB page alignment: don't move it without reading `.agents/context/distribution.md`. |

The wire codec uses **CBOR** (`kotlinx-serialization-cbor`) and the UI uses **Navigation Compose**. When
adding dependencies, pin versions in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`; a dep built with a Kotlin at or below our
overridden built-in Kotlin is readable, but still probe Maven before bumping anything that could pull in a
newer Kotlin stdlib.

## 16. Notable bugs fixed (lessons)

- **Self-joining coroutine deadlock (Nearby era).** In the since-retired Nearby transport, `connectTo`
  did `connectJob = scope.launch { connectJob?.join(); … }`; by the time the coroutine ran, `connectJob`
  pointed at *itself*, so it awaited itself forever and the connect never executed — devices discovered
  each other but never connected. The lesson still holds (don't await a job handle from inside that same
  job; a serialized dispatcher + a `connecting` guard fixed it); the current radios have their own
  lifecycle traps — the single-NDI wedges in `AGENTS.md` / `docs/DIGEST_PULL_REATTACH.md`.
- **One-character text fields.** Binding a Compose `TextField`'s `value` directly to a
  DataStore-backed `StateFlow` lags a keystroke behind (the write→emit round-trip is async), so
  Compose resets the field and only one character registers. Fixed by holding editable text in a
  local `MutableStateFlow` updated synchronously, persisting to DataStore in the background
  (`ProfileViewModel`).
- **Edge-to-edge keyboard overlap.** With `enableEdgeToEdge`, the chat input bar was covered by the
  IME. Fixed with `Modifier.imePadding().navigationBarsPadding()` on the input surface.

## 17. Testing strategy

- **JVM unit tests** (`app/src/test/`, no hardware):
  - Wire/protocol: `WireSerializationTest` (CBOR round-trips incl. the encrypted `chat` frame),
    `FrameSignatureTest` (the single-frame signature), `ProtocolTest` (endpoint-info advert parse),
    `SeenSetTest` (dedup/TTL/eviction), `MeshRouterTest` (dedup, relay-excludes-source + hop increment,
    TTL drop, multi-hop delivery, and the **jittered overhear-suppression** cases — using a fixed
    `jitter` + virtual time), `LinkFramingTest`/`FramedLinkTest` (the socket record codec), and
    `BlobExchangeTest`/`BlobHashTest` (content-addressed pull).
  - Transports & custody: `CompositeMeshTransportTest` (plane merge/preference), `ForwardSyncTest` +
    `ForwardRepositoryTest` (store-and-forward custody + convergent quotas), `KeyExchangeTest` (`keyreq`
    recovery), `PendingInboundTest` (park-until-key), `StoreDigestTest` + `DigestTrackerTest` (cue-plane
    anti-entropy), and the pure BLE policies (`PromotionPolicyTest`, `ScanDemandPolicyTest`,
    `ConnectBackoffPolicyTest`, `BleAdvertPayloadTest`, `BlePresenceTrackerTest`, `PowerPolicyTest`).
  - Data/identity/UI logic: `ConversationsTest`, `ReactionRepositoryTest`, `MentionTest`,
    `MentionTextTest`, `NodeIdTest` / `SelfCertifyingIdentityTest` / `DeviceTagTest`, `AliasTest`, `PeerLabelsTest` / `NameKeyTest` (the `Name (Alias)` collision labels, ADR 058),
    `GroupNamingTest` / `GroupMembersStoreTest`, `NotificationTest`, `RelativeTimeTest`, `AvatarCropTest`.
  - E2E crypto: `MessageCryptoTest` (DM + N-member group seal/open; tampered ciphertext, wrong sender
    key, mismatched header, and non-recipient all rejected; bundle encode/decode) and `SafetyNumberTest`
    (symmetry across endpoints, determinism, change-detection, `VerifyPayload` parsing). Tink runs
    unchanged on the JVM, so these need no hardware.
  - Moderation: `LexicalTextFilterTest` (normalization/evasions/Scunthorpe), `HybridTextModeratorTest`
    (lexical short-circuit / ML fallthrough), `SentencePieceTokenizerTest` (HuggingFace-golden parity).
  - Run with `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`. Use `UnconfinedTestDispatcher` for flow-propagation
    tests and a fixed `jitter` lambda + virtual time for relay-timing tests.
- **Emulator smoke test** validates launch, Koin init, screen rendering, and service start — but an
  emulator has no Wi-Fi Aware or BLE peer radio, so it can't form a real mesh.
- **Two-to-three physical phones** validate discovery → connect → message relay over both radios,
  profile/avatar exchange, attachment pulls, store-and-forward backfill, and — with three nodes — that
  overhear suppression fires (`framesSuppressed > 0` in the metrics log) and the single-NDI cue/digest
  sync converges while messages still deliver.
- **Seeded UI instrumentation suite** (`app/src/androidTest/java/app/getknit/knit/ui/`) hunts device- and
  API-specific UI quirks on real hardware. The mesh radios can't run on a Firebase Test Lab (FTL) device,
  so the suite runs the **demo-seeded, radio-less build** (`-PseedDemo=true`): `DemoTransport` replaces the
  radios, `DemoSeeder` populates Room through the real repositories, and onboarding/`MeshService` are
  skipped, so every screen renders populated and deterministic. Tests assert on the seeded ids + existing
  `testTag`s and capture a screenshot each (via `UiAutomation` + test-services `TestStorage`, collected by
  FTL). Run locally (emulator OK — no real mesh) with `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
  -PseedDemo=true` (every attached adb device) or `./gradlew :app:pixel7api33DebugAndroidTest -PseedDemo=true`
  (a Gradle-managed emulator only — Pixel 7 @ API 33, ignores adb), or on FTL physical devices by submitting
  the seeded debug + `androidTest` APKs via `gcloud firebase test android run` (Android Test Orchestrator +
  `clearPackageData`, default matrix API 29/33/36). This is the UI-rendering complement to the radio-absent
  **graceful-degradation** logic, which the JVM tests above already cover (`CompositeMeshTransportTest`,
  `RadioWarningTest`, `OnboardingScreenContentTest`). See `AGENTS.md` for the full setup and gotchas.

## 18. Known limitations & deferred work

- DM/group messages are E2E-encrypted (§14), but they still **flood** the whole mesh (only the
  addressed recipient(s) decrypt/ack) — so relays see *who is talking to whom and how much* (the
  cleartext `recipientId`/`group` roster and sizes), just not the contents.
- **Forward secrecy is epoch-granular, not per-message:** DMs between current builds ratchet
  (`docs/FORWARD_SECRECY_RATCHET.md`) and fully-capable groups run the sender-key form
  (`docs/GROUP_FORWARD_SECRECY.md`), so exposure is bounded by the epoch/seed retention windows
  rather than zero; mixed-capability conversations fall back to the static v1 wrap until every
  participant upgrades.
- **The broadcast room is cleartext** by design (signed, not encrypted); receipts/reactions toward
  pre-ratchet targets fall back to their cleartext frames (the shrinking v1 residual — sealed forms
  are the default between current builds, ADR 018). *(The key-request/retransmit path for a frame
  received before its sender's key is pinned is now implemented — `KeyExchange` + `PendingInbound`,
  §3.5.)*
- Receipts/relays add some flood overhead (reduced by overhear suppression); no per-recipient delivery
  state beyond the single ✓, and DMs have **no routing table** (they flood; store-and-forward carries
  undelivered ones).
- Room migrations are **tested and non-destructive** from the v1 launch baseline on (there is no
  destructive fallback). The identity key lives outside the DB, so it survives regardless. *(Pre-1.0 alpha
  builds churned through destructive v2…v22 bumps that rode the wire/crypto breaks; that history is
  collapsed — see `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.)*
- **Deferred by design:** true (targeted) DM routing, encrypting the broadcast room, the v1-fallback
  residuals (cleartext receipts/reactions toward pre-ratchet peers; the group key-gap retransmit for
  v1-pinned groups — ratcheted groups heal via the seed outbox + key-request loop), and a BLE
  connect-time gate on A2DP audio contention (see `.agents/memory/roadmap.md`).
