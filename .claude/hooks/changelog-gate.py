"""PreToolUse gate for CHANGELOG.md: the countable half of `.agents/rules/changelog.md`.

Reads a PreToolUse payload on stdin (Edit / MultiEdit / Write), reconstructs what the file
would become, and compares the bullets under `## Unreleased` against the ones on disk. Only
*added* bullets are judged, so an edit whose `new_string` carries neighbouring bullets as
context can never be blamed for their prose.

It checks only what a machine can count exactly — length, wrap, and a short list of literal
strings that are never right in this file. Everything requiring taste (marketing register,
a closing sentence that restates the opening, a forced metaphor) belongs to the prompt hook
that runs beside it; this script deliberately says nothing about those. That split exists
because the prompt hook used to invent word counts and quote spans that were not in the text,
and blocked clean bullets on them.

Exit 0 = allow (also the answer to every parse failure or missing dependency: a gate that
cannot read its input must not wedge the file), exit 2 = block with the findings on stderr.
