/**
 * [BlobStore] backed by the encrypted [BlobRepository], bridging the mesh blob-exchange to the
 * database. Mesh file transfers stream as `LinkFraming` file records over the data-path socket, so this materializes
 * short-lived plaintext temp files in [transferDir] for outbound sends and ingests inbound staging
 * files into the database — deleting the decrypted staging copy as soon as the bytes are encrypted.
 *
 * [transferDir] holds only in-flight transfer files (never the canonical copy, which lives encrypted
 * in the DB) and is purged on mesh start via [clearTransfers]. The transient plaintext window is no
 * larger than the mesh file transfer itself — which, since a cut transfer resumes from the prefix the
 * receiver kept (`PartialBlobs`, ADR 2026-10.wtyc), can span several links within one session: those
 * prefixes are purged on mesh start too, and dropped once the blob lands or an hour after their last progress.
