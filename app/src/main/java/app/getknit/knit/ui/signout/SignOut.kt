/**
 * "Sign out here" (work item #80, ADR 2026-09.ypcc): this phone gives up the identity it shares with another
 * one. The mesh has no multi-device concept, so the only honest exit is the one a restore promised — a
 * move, not a copy — made enforceable from this side: the app closes and everything it holds on this phone
 * goes, and the next open is a fresh install's onboarding with a new identity.
 *
 * The wipe is [ActivityManager.clearApplicationUserData], the platform's own "Clear storage": every private
 * file (the wrapped identity and database keys, the database, the DataStore, the blobs, any restore
 * staging), the runtime permission grants, the notifications and the process itself. Nothing of the old
 * identity can linger for a file list to miss, and `IdentityKeyStore` / `DatabaseKey` mint fresh secrets the
 * next time they are touched, exactly as on first run. The cost is the grants: onboarding asks for the
 * radios again, which is also what makes the front door route there (entry is gated on those grants alone,
 * ADR 2026-09.nzpr). The pre-wipe checklist is `BackupViewModel.confirmRestore`'s: a plain `stopService`
 * (not `MeshService.stop`, which records "mesh off" — moot here, but the same door), then the notifications
 * and conversation shortcuts that name threads the next identity never had.
 *
 * The same wipe is the storage-unavailable screen's Start over (ADR 2026-10.47rw): a phone whose Keystore will not
 * unwrap its storage key can hold nothing worth keeping that this app could read, and the platform's clear also
 * drops the app's Keystore keys, so the next open mints under a fresh one.
