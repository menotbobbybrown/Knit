/**
 * [MeshTransport] over **Bluetooth LE** — the second mesh plane, running simultaneously with
 * [app.getknit.knit.mesh.wifiaware.WifiAwareTransport] behind [app.getknit.knit.mesh.CompositeMeshTransport].
 * Unlike Wi-Fi Aware's one-NDP-at-a-time constraint, BLE holds **many persistent links at once**, which is the
 * whole point (the dense-venue case): peers who stay near each other get responsive, always-on messaging
 * without data-path churn. It also serves as a legacy plane for phones lacking Wi-Fi Aware hardware.
 *
 * Three planes, like NAN's two plus one:
 * - **Coordination** — BLE advertising ([BleAdvertiser]) of the 24-byte [BleAdvertPayload] (nodeId + caps +
 *   digest cue + L2CAP PSM + flags) and duty-cycled scanning ([BleScanner]); every scan hit feeds
 *   [BlePresenceTracker] (smoothed RSSI, dwell, linger). Identity is the advertised nodeId, so a rotated BLE
 *   random address is transparent.
 * - **Data** — an L2CAP CoC socket per linked peer. The [PromotionPolicy] promotes a peer to a persistent link
 *   once it has dwelled long enough and is close enough (RSSI), bounded by a connection budget with
 *   weakest-first eviction. Each socket feeds the shared [FramedLink] (frames + files + store-and-forward
 *   digests, identical to NAN).
 * - **Side channel** ([BleSideChannel], optional — null while the build keeps it dark) — the fast plane
 *   ([hasFastPlane]): small floodable frames on non-connectable extended-advertising pages, connectionless,
 *   so they bypass a file transfer head-of-line-blocking a stream and reach a sighted-but-unlinked peer.
 *   [fastFanout] keeps the link copy the composite used to send for us and adds the page; [fastSend] is the
 *   link only — nothing DM-form rides a broadcast carrier. Gated per peer on the advert flag
 *   ([SideCapableTracker]); the receive scan runs only while such a peer is sighted but unlinked, or a file is
 *   streaming on one of our links ([SideScanPolicy]) — linked peers already get the link copy.
 *
 * - **Coded PHY** (an experiment, ADR 2026-10.yvn6 — [phyMode] reads OFF unless `BuildConfig.BLE_CODED_PHY`) — a
 *   second, extended presence set on the Coded PHY and an all-PHY presence scan, so a peer is found and dialed past
 *   1M range; each link to a peer heard on Coded gets a [BlePhyControl] that steps it between 1M and Coded S=8.
 *
 * Insecure/pairless L2CAP (no system pairing dialog): real authentication is the per-frame Ed25519 signature +
 * E2E layer above the transport, so link-layer bonding is redundant. Permissions are gated at onboarding and
 * the transport self-degrades if one is missing, so the Bluetooth calls are [SuppressLint] "MissingPermission".
