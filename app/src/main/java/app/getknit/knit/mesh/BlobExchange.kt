/**
 * Demand-driven, content-addressed image fetch over the mesh. A node that needs a blob it lacks asks
 * its direct neighbors ([want]); a neighbor that holds it serves it back over the file channel, and
 * one that doesn't pulls it on the asker's behalf ([onRequest] → [want]) so the asker's *next* ask finds
 * a holder one hop closer. The blob therefore walks hop-by-hop to any requester using only direct-neighbor
 * file transfer — no file-relay-by-destination is needed. The re-ask is the 60 s neighbor re-offer
 * ([onNeighborAdded], re-armed from the database by `MeshManager.rewantMissingBlobs`, ADR 2026-09.ptv8);
 * nothing is ever pushed to a peer that did not just ask, because the serving side cannot tell a peer
 * that still lacks the bytes from one whose copy is already on the way from somebody else — a clique
 * that pushed bought every recipient a copy per neighbor (work item #79, ADR 2026-09.4tx5).
 *
 * A blob whose bytes are already streaming in on a link (a key of [MeshTransport.arrivingFiles]) is neither
 * wanted nor re-asked for; a re-ask for one already queued toward that peer ([MeshTransport.fileInFlightTo])
 * ships nothing. Both are reads of the link, not memos here — a torn link clears its own state.
 *
 * The `blobreq` that drives [onRequest] is **unsigned** (see `MeshManager.verifyInbound`), so, like
 * [KeyExchange]/[PendingInbound], the bookkeeping is **bounded**: [fetching] is capped (oldest-first
 * eviction) and TTL-swept ([sweepExpired]); the [recentlyServed] serve-memo keeps its 45 s TTL plus a size
 * cap. A peer flooding requests for hashes we don't hold therefore costs bounded memory and work.
 *
 * A transfer a link drop cut off resumes rather than restarts (work item #116, ADR 2026-10.wtyc): the link keeps
 * the prefix in [PartialBlobs], every ask names its length as the `blobreq` offset, a holder streams only the
 * rest ([onRequest]), and a spliced file that fails its hash check drops the prefix and asks from byte 0
 * ([onReceived]). A holder that predates the field serves the whole file, which lands as before.
 *
 * Pure (no Android/Room): the transport, blob storage, and identity are injected, so the recursion
 * can be unit-tested with [FakeLoopTransport] and a fake [BlobStore].
