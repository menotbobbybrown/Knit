/**
 * Rings the GATT doorbell of the peer on one Bluetooth link (ADR 2026-09.dqvb): a write without response to
 * [DoorbellPolicy.DOORBELL_UUID], over the ACL the link's L2CAP channel already runs on. The transport makes one per
 * link whose HELLO carries [app.getknit.knit.mesh.protocol.Protocol.CAP_DOORBELL] — an iPhone that dialed us — and
 * [poke]s it after each frame that rings ([DoorbellPolicy.rings]); [DoorbellPolicy.Schedule] decides when.
 *
 * One coroutine owns the GATT client and the schedule, woken through a conflated channel, so a poke never blocks the
 * writer and a ring asked for during the lookup waits for it. The trailing ring of a burst is that loop's timeout.
 *
 * **The lookup** runs at link-up, before any ring (#102). `connectGatt` on a device with an open LE link attaches a
 * client to that link rather than dialing (AOSP `gatt_connect`), which is why the attach window is [ATTACH_TIMEOUT_MS]
 * and the link is re-checked ([isLive]) just before: if the ACL is already gone, the call would dial the peer's address
 * instead, and closing the client on the timeout cancels that dial. The client holds the ACL while it is open, so it
 * never outlives the link — [close] ends it with the link. A peer with no doorbell (or one that takes no write without
 * a response, which is the only kind a suspended app can take without holding the link up) is not asked again on this
 * link, and its client is closed at once; the open CoC keeps the ACL up without it.
 *
 * **Each lookup that finds the doorbell also asks for [BluetoothGatt.CONNECTION_PRIORITY_BALANCED]** (#102). An iPhone
 * that dialed us is the link's central and runs it at a 720 ms supervision timeout, which drops the link at the first
 * 0.72 s without a good packet. The stack's own update for the discovery asks for 5 s and gets it, then asks for the
 * link's first values back once discovery ends. BALANCED is AOSP's 30–50 ms at no latency with the 5 s timeout every
 * priority carries, inside Apple's accessory limits, and iOS grants it. The put-back can still land after the ask, so
 * the ask is repeated when the link reports a timeout under 5 s after it, and once more at the settle time unless the
 * 5 s was reported ([DoorbellPolicy.Balanced]). It is asked after every lookup, so a
 * re-lookup's discovery (after a wedge or a services change) is followed by the request again. That is why the lookup
 * runs at link-up: the link spends no time at 720 ms waiting for its first ring, and a replaced link, which gets no
 * link-up push, still gets it.
 *
 * Callbacks arrive on a binder thread (the four-arg `connectGatt` passes no Handler); each lookup gets its own
 * [Client], whose deferreds are made before the call, so nothing is handed between threads through a plain field.
 *
 * Device-verified only — there is no host GATT stack — like [app.getknit.knit.mesh.bluetooth.meshtastic.MeshtasticGatt];
 * the rules it follows are [DoorbellPolicy]'s, which are JVM-tested.
