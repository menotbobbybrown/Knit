/**
 * A [MeshTransport] that carries the mesh's small floodable frames over LoRa via a Meshtastic board
 * ([MeshtasticLink]), extending the reach of the **Nearby room** beyond BLE/NAN range. It is a
 * fast-plane-ONLY child of [app.getknit.knit.mesh.CompositeMeshTransport] (added last, lowest preference):
 *
 * - [neighbors] is always empty, so the reliable flood, custody digest sync, key requests, blob pulls and
 *   the `watchNeighbors` hooks never touch a ~1 kbps link — [send]/[sendFile]/[sendDigest] are no-ops.
 * - [fastFanout]/[longRangeFanout]/[fastSend] are the only outbound paths: they decode the envelope (never
 *   re-encoding it — `sig`/`signed` pass through [FastFrameCodec] byte-exact), apply [LoraFramePolicy], skip
 *   a DM-form frame a live link already carries ([coveredByLink], ADR 054), compact/fragment via
 *   [LoraFrameCodec], and pace the result ([LoraPacePolicy]) onto the board. The long-range path is what
 *   carries sealed DM-form chat (ADR 039); this plane is the only one it exists for.
 * - inbound packets are decoded/reassembled and injected into [inbound] exactly like the Wi-Fi Aware fast
 *   plane's `emitFastWire`, so the router's dedup/verify/custody/relay all run unchanged.
 * - [shortRange] is false: a LoRa sighting doesn't imply proximity, so siblings ignore its `reachable` set
 *   and nothing above the composite may read it as *nearby* (`MeshController.neighbors` is the short-range
 *   set for exactly this reason). [reachable] here is keyed on the frame **author**, and a gateway puts
 *   other people's frames on air, so a peer with no board of its own can be reachable over this plane.
 *   Only a frame that passes [app.getknit.knit.mesh.isPresenceEvidence] counts — a custody re-serve says
 *   where a frame has been, not where its author is. The Internet plane keys presence off the same rule.
 *
 * On first hearing a peer the transport also re-offers the carried DM-form frames addressed to it
 * ([reofferTo]) — the plane's only backfill, since custody's digest sync needs a data path.
 *
 * Key bootstrap over LoRa (the far side has never seen the author's profile) rides two paths: the mesh's
 * existing `watchReachable` reflood, plus a self-profile beacon this transport sends on session-up (under a
 * 5-min floor) and on first hearing a peer (under a 60-s gap, so a two-sided bootstrap completes without a
 * periodic beacon — [beaconProfile]). A **relayed** profile is fanned once per publish ([profileSeen],
 * ADR 057) rather than on every flood-dedup lapse, and repaired — when a far pocket really lacks one — by
 * the bridge's digest-driven backfill rather than by re-offering it to everyone.
 *
 * Its rate limiters outlive the process ([LoraPlaneState]): the airtime ledger, the beacon floor, the gossip
 * interval, the serve cap and the profile re-fan gate are all read back at [start] and written behind a
 * debounce, because a limiter that resets on launch is not a limiter — a restart used to hand this plane a
 * fresh 45-second allowance and re-run every "first time" behaviour against it.
 *
 * [clock] is monotonic (pacing, dedup, linger); [wallClock] is the epoch clock a frame's `sentAt` is stamped
 * in, read by the freshness gate and by the persisted limiters (a monotonic stamp cannot survive a reboot).
 * Pure/Android-free — the
 * only `android.bluetooth.*` sits behind the [MeshtasticLink]/[MeshtasticGattDialer] seam.
 *
 * Large by suppression, as [MeshtasticSession] is: this is the plane's single owner. The pacer loop, the
 * gossip loop, the linger sweep, the gateway election and the published status all read and write one set
 * of mutable fields under one scope, so splitting it would mean a second owner of that state.
