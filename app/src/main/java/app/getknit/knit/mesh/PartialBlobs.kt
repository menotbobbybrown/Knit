/**
 * The prefixes of attachments a link drop cut off, kept so the next ask can resume where the bytes stopped
 * instead of at byte 0 (work item #116, ADR 2026-10.wtyc). A link at the edge of Bluetooth or Coded range can
 * drop every few minutes; when every answer restarted from nothing, a large attachment could fail forever while
 * both phones paid for the airtime.
 *
 * A link's `FileIntake` hands its temp file here when the link is cut mid-stream ([keep]); `BlobExchange` asks
 * with the kept length as the `blobreq` offset ([length]); a holder that understands it streams the tail, and the
 * next intake splices that tail onto a copy of the prefix ([open]). Bytes for a hash are the same at every
 * holder, so any holder can finish what another started, and the whole file is still checked against its hash
 * before it is stored (`MeshBlobStore.saveIncoming`) — a bad splice costs one tail, never a wrong blob.
 *
 * - **Session-scoped.** [purge] runs at every mesh start beside `MeshBlobStore.clearTransfers`: a room photo, an
 *   avatar or a group photo crosses the link as plaintext, and the blob layer keeps no plaintext on disk past
 *   the transfer it belongs to. A resumed transfer is one transfer spread over several links, so a partial
 *   lives no longer than that: until the blob lands, [ttlMs] after its last progress, or the session ends.
 * - **Immutable once kept.** A longer prefix replaces a kept one by rename, and a drop or eviction deletes it,
 *   so a reader holding an [open] stream reads a file nothing writes to: the copy runs outside [lock] without
 *   a link's `close()` ever waiting behind another link's 8 MiB copy.
 * - **Keep-the-longer.** A whole-file stream never discards a kept prefix: a holder that ignores the offset (an
 *   older build, the iOS port before its companion change) streams from 0, and a short cut of that stream must
 *   not cost an 80 % prefix someone else delivered.
 * - **Epochs.** [drop] retires every copy built on the dropped prefix: a resumed copy still streaming when its
 *   sibling failed the hash check would otherwise bring the bad prefix back when it, too, is cut.
 * - **Bounded.** At most [maxCount] partials and [maxBytes] in all, oldest evicted first; a prefix under
 *   [minBytes] is not worth a file. The key is the peer's claim, so only a well-formed content hash ever names a
 *   file here ([isValidBlobHash]), and the name is checked to stay inside [dir].
 *
 * Pure of Android, thread-safe, every disk touch under one short-held [lock] except the caller's copy.
