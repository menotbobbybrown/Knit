/**
 * The BLE presence model: per-peer smoothed RSSI, continuous-presence dwell, and last-seen linger — fed by
 * scan sightings and read by [PromotionPolicy] (which decides who to link) and the transport (which exposes
 * `reachable` to the UI). Identity is the advertised **nodeId**, never the MAC, so a rotated BLE
 * resolvable-random-address simply lands as a fresh sighting under the same nodeId.
 *
 * A peer heard on both PHYs (the Coded PHY experiment, ADR 2026-10.yvn6) keeps one smoothed RSSI per PHY — the two
 * read on different scales — and its [Snapshot.smoothedRssi] is the stronger of them on the 1M scale
 * ([CodedPhyPolicy.effectiveRssi], at the credit [codedCreditDb] names), so every consumer's −90 floor keeps meaning
 * what it meant. A PHY's reading counts only while that PHY was heard in the same burst as the peer's latest sighting.
 * Coded hits are far sparser than 1M ones (a 1 s advert, a scan that shares its window), so a Coded sighting that
 * follows a Coded sighting is continuous presence across [PresenceConfig.codedGapResetMs], not the 1M gap.
 *
 * Whether a peer is heard on Coded alone ([Snapshot.codedLagMs]) is measured on a clock that runs only while a scan
 * window listens on 1M ([onOneMListening]): a Coded-only window cannot hear a 1M advert, so its hits are no evidence
 * that the peer has none. The clock's reading at each peer's last 1M hit outlives its presence entry (a screen-off
 * scan is 8 s windows two minutes apart, so presence restarts every window).
 *
 * Pure of Android and driven by an injected clock (all methods take `now`), so it is JVM-unit-testable with a
 * virtual clock ([app.getknit.knit.BlePresenceTrackerTest]) exactly like the other pure mesh components.
