 *   opaque [signed] blob it covers. A relay rewrites only ttl/hops ([WireEnvelope.relayed]); [signed]
 *   and [sig] pass through byte-for-byte, so the originator's exact signed bytes survive every hop.
 * - [RelayEnvelope] (layer 2, what [signed] decodes to) carries only the cleartext fields a relay or
 *   store-and-forward carrier needs to route ([type]/[id]/[senderId]/[recipientId]/[group]) plus an
 *   opaque [payload]. Because relays never re-encode it, new fields can be added here too: an old relay
 *   ignores them on decode ([WireCodec] uses `ignoreUnknownKeys`) yet still forwards the original bytes.
 * - The per-type content (layer 3: [ChatContent], [ProfileContent], …) lives inside [payload] and is
 *   parsed only by endpoints, so it evolves freely — new fields and even new [type] values are invisible
 *   to relays, which forward them verbatim instead of dropping them.
 *
 * The single [sig] over [signed] authenticates every type (the previous split between a frame signature
 * and a separate envelope signature is gone). [type]/[id]/[senderId] ride inside [signed], so a

 *
 * [loraNode] is the Meshtastic node number of the board this phone currently holds (unsigned 32 bits,
 * widened), so a contact's phone can line a post its own board heard on the radio channel up with this
 * one. Nullable rather than defaulted because 0 is not a node number; elided while unbound, and absent on a

 * [loraKey] lets it check one.
 *
 * [loraKey] is that board's Curve25519 public key (base64 of the 32 raw bytes, the `pubKey`/`avatarHash`
 * string convention), advertised **only while the board's firmware signs**: Meshtastic 2.8 signs every
 * broadcast a board originates that fits, and a contact's phone verifies a heard post's signature against
 * this key (`mesh/crypto/XeddsaVerify`) before showing the post as ours. Same shape as [loraNode] — nullable,
 * elided while unbound or on a board that does not sign, absent clears, a presentation field on all three
 * layouts. What it proves is bounded: the radio named here transmitted the words, not that this person
 * typed them. Bound to this identity by the frame's own signature, which covers every field of this content.

 * [version] is the sender's own profile version — the same monotonic value a cleartext profile frame
 * puts in its `sentAt`. Carrying it explicitly, rather than reusing the carrying chat frame's `sentAt`,
 * is what lets the two propagation paths order against **one** number: a re-sent ctl would otherwise
 * arrive stamped later than a genuinely newer cleartext profile and gate it out.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than [ProfileContent]: only the presentation fields move. [ProfileContent.pubKey]
 * stays out because an identity re-pin is a trust-on-first-use event that must ride the authenticated
 * cleartext frame, and [ProfileContent.prekey] stays out because its whole job is to *start* a session —
 * sealing it under a session that must already exist is circular. Neither is a size decision; both are

 * [avatarHash] names the same content-addressed blob the cleartext form does. The carrying chat frame
 * repeats it in [ChatContent.attachmentHash] — the hash alone, never a mime (ADR 035) — so a blind

 * field carried by the cleartext frame alone would be reverted by the next sealed update. [loraNode]
 * mirrors [ProfileContent.loraNode] for the same reason (nullable, elided while unbound, absent clears),

/**
 * The end-to-end encryption envelope carried inside an encrypted [ChatContent]. A random per-message
 * content key encrypts the [app.getknit.knit.mesh.crypto.MessageContent] with AES-256-GCM into [ct]
 * under [nonce] (both raw byte strings — CBOR `@ByteString`, not base64: the envelope already rides a
 * binary CBOR frame, so base64 only inflated these ~33%); that content key is wrapped once per recipient
 * into [keys]. [v] is the crypto-scheme version (omitted on the wire while it equals the default); an
 * unsupported version is dropped on delivery (see `MeshManager.decrypt`). Authenticated by the frame
 * [sig] (which covers the whole [ChatContent] payload), so a wrapped key or ciphertext can't be replayed
 * into another message. A plain `class` (see [WrappedKey]) so the `@ByteString` fields don't inherit a
 * broken data-class `equals`.
 *
 * **v2 (the ratchet schemes — both landed in the same, never-released bump, so they share one
 * version)**: the AEAD key is *derived* from ratchet state, never wrapped — [keys] is empty. The two
 * forms are discriminated by addressing, not by [v]: a **DM** ([RelayEnvelope.recipientId] set)
 * carries the epoch-ratchet header [r] (docs/FORWARD_SECRECY_RATCHET.md); a **group** frame
 * ([RelayEnvelope.group] set) carries the sender-key header [g] (docs/GROUP_FORWARD_SECRECY.md).
 * v1 ↔ v2 discrimination is [v] alone; [r]/[g] are additive (nullable, ignored by older builds) per
 * docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md rule 1, with `@ByteString` bytes living inside the new [RatchetHeader]/
 * [RatchetInit] types rather than as defaulted fields here (rule 1's exception).
 *
 * **v3 (the compact DM form, ADR 059)** is v2's DM form with two things removed from the bytes and
 * nothing removed from the shape: [nonce] rides **empty** (the AEAD nonce is derived from the single-use
 * message key, `RatchetCrypto.messageNonce`), and the plaintext inside [ct] is the labeled
 * [app.getknit.knit.mesh.crypto.MessageContentV2] schema rather than `MessageContent`'s named one. The
 * ratchet header is additionally bound into the AEAD's associated data, which is what lets a
 * `relay = false` v3 tick travel with no frame signature at all. [nonce] stays a required field rather
 * than becoming nullable because a build that cannot decode the envelope cannot **carry** it either
 * (`InboundPipeline.canCarry` decodes the chat payload), and custody must converge across builds
 * (ADR 006) — so a v3 frame is shaped so that every fielded build decodes it, refuses it at the
 * version gate, and keeps custodying it. Group form stays v2.
