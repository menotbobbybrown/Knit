/**
 * A [MeshTransport] that runs several sibling transports **simultaneously** behind the single-transport seam,
 * so `MeshManager`/`MeshRouter` and every collaborator stay unchanged. [children] are in descending
 * send-preference order — put Bluetooth (persistent, cheap links) before Wi-Fi Aware (ephemeral, one NDP at a
 * time), so a peer reachable over both is served over Bluetooth.
 *
 * How the interface members combine:
 * - [neighbors]/[reachable]: the union of the children's sets, **collapsed to one [Peer] per nodeId** (the
 *   richer advertised protoVersion/capabilities wins). Collapsing by nodeId is what makes
 *   `MeshManager.watchNeighbors` fire its newcomer hooks exactly once even when a peer appears on both planes.
 * - [health]: Healthy if **any** child is Healthy (the node can still mesh if one radio works); otherwise
 *   ForegroundOnly if a plane is up but discovers only on screen (the API 29-32 location app-op, ADR
 *   2026-09.535d), else Degraded if any plane is on-but-failing (seized), else Unavailable when every plane
 *   is switched off/absent.
 * - [inbound]/[incomingFiles]/[incomingDigests]: merged. A frame that arrives over both planes is de-duped
 *   downstream by `MeshRouter`'s `SeenSet` (10-min TTL), so simultaneous multi-path delivery is safe and free.
 * - [send]: for a specific peer, route to the preferred child holding a live link to it; for a broadcast
 *   (`to == null`), reach each merged neighbor once over its preferred child.
 * - [fastFanout]/[fastSend]: the coordination-plane fast path goes to children that have one ([hasFastPlane]:
 *   Wi-Fi Aware, Bluetooth with its side channel, LoRa); a link-based child without one instead gets a normal
 *   [send] over its persistent links, which already reaches every live neighbor at once.
 *
 * A 0- or 1-child list is handled gracefully (empty ⇒ inert + Degraded; single ⇒ transparent pass-through),
 * so DI can gate each plane on hardware support and hand over whatever is present.
 *
 * Because neighbors are collapsed by nodeId, a peer that is continuously reachable (e.g. a persistent Bluetooth
 * link, or a NAN→BT handoff that never leaves the merged set) fires `MeshManager.watchNeighbors`' newcomer
 * hooks only **once**. Store-and-forward convergence relies on the digest re-offer re-running (NAN gets that for
 * free from its flapping ephemeral links), so `MeshManager.reofferToNeighborsPeriodically` re-runs those hooks
 * on a timer for currently-linked neighbors — the anti-entropy a non-flapping link needs.
