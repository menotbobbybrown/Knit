/**
 * Transport-agnostic mesh logic: deduplicates incoming frames, delivers new ones locally, and floods
 * them onward bounded by the frame's TTL.
 *
 * Rather than rebroadcasting immediately (blind flooding, which storms a dense cluster with O(n²)
 * redundant sends), a first-seen frame's relay is scheduled after a small random [jitter] delay. If,
 * during that window, the same frame is overheard from enough neighbors ([suppressThreshold]) — i.e.
 * a neighbor already relayed it — the pending relay is cancelled. This counter-based suppression cuts
 * redundant traffic in dense meshes while still relaying reliably in sparse ones (where no duplicate
 * is overheard). Locally-originated frames bypass this and send immediately.
 *
 * A point-to-point frame (`relay = false`) is never flooded, but it is not necessarily finished either: if it
 * is addressed to a peer this node holds a live link to, [handOn] takes it that one hop.
 *
 * Kept free of Android/Room/transport dependencies so it can be unit-tested with a fake transport.

     * ours, and a room tick never escalates into custody (ADR 2026-09.aa27). So the gateway does for the tick
     * exactly what it already does for the post that earned it.
     *
     * Five things bound it, and each is the same rule the flood path already follows:
     *  - **DM-form chat only** ([shouldFastSend]): the sealed `CTL_RECEIPT` tick and any future sealed ctl DM.
     *    A `typing` cue is worthless a moment later, and `blobreq`/`keyreq` name no recipient at all — they
     *    propagate through their own handlers.
     *  - **Split horizon**: never back at the hop that just handed it to us.
     *  - **The hop count**, capped to the local [DEFAULT_TTL] exactly as [scheduleRelay] caps it, so an
     *    attacker-controlled `ttl` cannot keep a frame alive past the dedup window.
     *  - **A live link, never a sighting** — `neighbors`, not `reachable` (ADR 044: a sighting is not a data
     *    path, and [app.getknit.knit.mesh.lora.LoraMeshTransport.fastSend] reads the link set for the same
     *    reason).
     *  - **Once per frame**, from the [SeenSet] gate in [handleInbound] that got us here.
     *
     * A frame addressed to *us* is never handed on, and that needs no identity here: our own node id is never
     * in our own neighbor set. Sent immediately rather than jittered — overhear suppression says nothing about
     * a unicast to one named peer.
     *
     * The frame may be one this node cannot verify (ADR 059's unsigned tick authenticates at its addressee and
     * nowhere else). That is the flood path's position too: an unverifiable frame is relayed, never delivered,
     * because a relay that drops what it cannot read is a propagation black hole.
