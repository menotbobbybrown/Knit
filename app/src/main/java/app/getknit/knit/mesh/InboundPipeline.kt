/**
 * The inbound half of the mesh, extracted from [MeshManager]: it owns delivery of every frame the router
 * hands up — authenticate ([verifyInbound]), custody ([onDeliver]'s pre-relay [ForwardSync.onSeen]),
 * dispatch by type, decrypt, persist, notify, ack — plus the store-and-forward carry gate ([canCarry]) and
 * the avatar/group-photo/attachment screening. Pulled out so the security gate and its three load-bearing
 * ordering contracts are a focused, JVM-testable unit ([onDeliver] is directly drivable — see
 * `InboundPipelineTest`):
 *
 *  - **custody-before-relay** — [onDeliver] carries a floodable frame ([ForwardSync.onSeen], `ORIGIN_RELAY`)
 *    before dispatch returns and before the router schedules the relay, so the copy is durable pre-flood.
 *  - **replay-runs-last** — [handleProfile] pins the sender's key, then replays any frames parked in
 *    [PendingInbound] by re-entering [onDeliver] as its **last** step, so the key + any deviceTag block are
 *    applied first. The group analogue: [reconcileGroup] commits the roster, then replays any seed ctl DM
 *    parked in [PendingGroupKeys] because it arrived for a group we did not hold yet.
 *  - **no-throw-out-of-onDeliver** — [verifyInbound]/[decrypt] are `runCatching`-wrapped so a failure drops
 *    the frame locally but never throws, letting the router still relay it (it runs after onDeliver returns).
 *
 * [MeshManager] still **owns** the six DTN services and the outbound origination choke; this pipeline
 * receives the services by reference and reaches origination through the [originate]/[flushPending] lambdas
 * (and moderation through [classifyText]) — the same lambda-mediation the DTN services already use. It holds
 * no coroutine/session state, so it needs no start/stop hooks.

     *   sender column and somebody else's in the origin, and `originNode` is what tells the two apart
     *   everywhere a row is read.
     * - **A contact, resolved once.** The speaker's node number is looked up against the profiles that claim
     *   it ([PeerRepository.findByLoraNode], newest wins) at ingest, and the answer is frozen on the row as
     *   [MeshPostOrigin.peerId]. Boards change hands; resolving at render time would re-attribute history to
     *   whoever holds the board now. Still an attribution, not an identity: a node number is self-asserted
     *   and unsigned, so the UI keeps the unverified styling. No peer row is ever created here — nothing
     *   touches `peers`, presence, `reachable`, open-to-chat or the contacts picker.
     * - **The blocklist is read on the resolved contact only.** Blocking is keyed on Knit node ids; a
     *   Meshtastic node number is not one and is trivially spoofable, so a per-speaker block would be a promise
     *   the radio cannot keep — but a post from a blocked contact's own board is dropped like their chat is.

     * - `weAreInitiator == true` — `RatchetEngine.initiate` wrote OUR clock. Comparing it against the
     *   peer's `sentAt` spans two devices, and a peer whose clock lags ours has every frame classified
     *   pre-era until the skew is worked off — the heuristic silently disabled in that direction, on a
     *   population that often runs for weeks without network time.
     *
     * For that half: [Protocol.MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_MS] absorbs ordinary disagreement, and

     * divergence whatever the peer thinks the time is.

     *   same stale pair from an older build, or two members setting a photo in one millisecond, and only the
     *   first of those ever happens. With no photo held a tie still takes, so a hash with no clock is adopted.
     * - **Shown** ([PhotoDecision.shown], `photoShownHash`): follows the decided photo once its blob is local
     *   and, with content filtering on, not flagged explicit; until then the previous photo keeps showing and
     *   [PhotoDecision.pull] names the hash to fetch. A frame re-asserting the decided photo re-arms that pull,
     *   so a want lost to a restart or the fetch TTL comes back with the group's next frame.
     *
     * A photo screening refused (filtering on, verdict flagged) is still the decided one — the group goes on
     * advertising it — but is never shown and never fetched again: its kept verdict says so
