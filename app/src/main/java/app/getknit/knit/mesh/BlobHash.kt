 * transfer directory, and recomputing it over the received bytes ([sha256Hex]) stops a holder from
 * serving arbitrary bytes under someone else's address (content-address / cache poisoning).

 * side) as identical `when` blocks that had to be extended together; arbitrary files gave that duplication
 * a third arm to get wrong, so it became one function instead.
 *
 * `jpg` stays the fallback for an unknown image-ish type — it is the universal default across the blob layer
 * (`ScopeSync.FALLBACK_MIME`, `MeshManager.AVATAR_MIME`) — but anything that is plainly not media now lands
 * on `bin` rather than being called a photo.
