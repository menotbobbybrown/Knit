/**
 * The short-range planes' author-presence tracker — the evidence behind the "Reachable indirectly" tier
 * (`ui/Reach.kt`, ADR 2026-10.fw8g): peers whose own recent frames reached us across the BLE / Wi-Fi Aware
 * mesh through some *other* phone. `MeshController.neighbors` only holds peers our own radio sighted, so a
 * peer two hops out whose DMs and receipts were arriving all along used to read as merely Known.
 *
 * The third of three such trackers and shaped like the other two (LoRa's `noteReachable`, the spool's
 * `ScopeStatus.peerSeenAt`, ADR 2026-09.2ajk): stamped with **our** clock at acceptance, read through one
 * function ([indirectPeers]) that applies the linger with the reader's clock, so a sweep running late after
 * the CPU slept never shows a stale peer. [note] runs once per first-seen frame, after `InboundPipeline`
 * verified it; [isRelayedRadioEvidence] is the rule.
 *
 * [stop] closes it as well as clearing it, under the same lock every write takes: `MeshManager.stop()` cancels
 * the session without waiting for it, so a frame already past `verifyInbound` can still reach [note] after the
 * clear — and a paused mesh would then show that peer for a whole linger, with the sweep that would have dropped
 * it gone with the session. A closed tracker records nothing until [start].
 *
 * Presentation only — never a delivery, routing or custody gate. Nothing in `mesh/` reads [heard]; a caller
 * that lets it decide where a frame goes has invented a routing table on evidence that was never meant to
 * carry one.
 *
 * Pure — no Android — so it is unit-tested directly and runs unchanged inside the `mesh/lab` nodes.

/**
 * Whether a frame that arrived over the radio mesh proves its **author** is reachable through another phone.
 * Every condition is load-bearing:
 *  - **not LoRa, not the spool** — both have their own tracker, and both hand frames over keyed on the
 *    author anyway. The lab's transports report [TransportKind.Other], so this names the planes it excludes
 *    rather than the ones it admits.
 *  - **the author is not the hop** — a frame its author handed us directly is a link or a sighting, which
 *    `neighbors` already covers. This also drops, with no code of its own, every path that cannot name a
 *    hop: a BLE side-channel page and a NAN fast-frame whose hop is unknown both report the author as the
 *    source, as do the `MeshManager` custody replays and a `typing` cue (single-hop by design).
 *  - **signed** — only a frame `verifyInbound` checked against the key its sender id binds to. The unsigned
 *    door (a v3 sealed tick, opened later) and an unchecked `blobreq` name a sender nobody has verified yet.
 *  - **fresh** — [PRESENCE_FRESH_MS] for every type, profiles included. Deliberately stricter than
 *    [isPresenceEvidence]'s 13 h profile window: on this plane other people's profiles are handed over all the
 *    time (`KeyExchange.serveKey`, custody re-serves on every new link), so only a fresh publish says its
 *    author is out there now.
 *
 * Presence only, like [isPresenceEvidence]: a frame that fails this is delivered, custodied and relayed
 * exactly as before.
