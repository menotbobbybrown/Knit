 * upgrade: a captive or filtered Wi-Fi the platform still calls validated holds a socket for the entire
 * connect timeout with nothing coming back, and counting that as connected made the plane, the chat
 * header and every coverage rule say "live" about a relay that had never answered (work item 50).
 *
 * [lastError] is the most recent `err` code this spool answered with — the difference between
 * "connected but idle" and "connected and refusing us", which is otherwise invisible and is exactly
 * what a field test needs (`quota`, `pow` and `rate` all present as a scope that simply never
 * converges) — or one of the client's own verdicts on it: [ScopeSync.UNREACHABLE] (no response of any
 * kind came back from the route, or the URL could not be dialled at all), [ScopeSync.NO_HELLO] (the
 * socket opened and the spool never said hello), [ScopeSync.OVERLONG_LISTING],
 * [SpoolConnection.UNRESPONSIVE], and `too_large` when its `maxRecord` could not carry our SUB.
 *
 * [dialFailures] counts the sessions in a row that ended without a completed hello, and is 0 the moment
 * one completes. A relay that has failed twelve dials running is in a different state from one that
 * missed a single reconnect, and the number is what tells a field log the two apart.
 *
 * [maxAttachBytes] is this spool's HELLO-advertised per-scope attachment budget, or **null** when it
 * advertised no attachment support at all (spec §7.3 — the three limits arrive together or not at all,
 * and a client must not send an attachment record to a spool that omitted them). Null is therefore not
 * "unknown" but "this spool carries frames only", which is what lets the UI say so before a send rather
 * than leaving a photo silently un-relayed. It is null while disconnected for the same reason a hello
