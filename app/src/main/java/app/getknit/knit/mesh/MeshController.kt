 * send/lifecycle actions the UI ViewModels, the foreground [MeshService], and the notification/debug
 * entry points use. Extracted as an interface over [MeshManager] (ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW #15) so those
 * callers bind a narrow seam a test can fake, instead of the concrete orchestrator (which drags in the
 * whole DI graph — transport, repos, crypto, DTN services). [MeshManager] is the only production impl.
 *
 * The `sendChat` defaults live here (an override may not restate them), so every caller must reach the
 * mesh through this interface to get them — which is why all consumers inject `MeshController`, not the
