/**
 * The Internet plane between real stacks — the real `ScopeSync` on every node over one in-process
 * [FakeSpool], which is the shape of the device trials the spool work still owes (ADR 064): two islands
 * sharing a group through one relay and a departure rotating its scope, a receive-only peer deriving the
 * same DM scope (ADR 032), a photo the radio already carried not being uploaded until the peers part
 * (ADR 021), a planted blob quarantined without breaking convergence (spec §9.3), two card holders meeting
 * at the pair scope with no radio (ADR 042), a relay that drops every socket, and a sealed profile update
 * crossing the relay (ADR 020). Slow by nature: the scope table derives on its inputs' events (a confirmed
 * session, a pair peer named or pinned, a root minted or adopted, a room joined — ADR 2026-09.dcah) with a
 * 60 s poll under the calendar-only transitions, a round runs on a change (a moved digest, a delivery, a
 * custody change) and a worker that missed one waits for its own 60 s tick (ADR 2026-09.wa79), hence
 * [MeshLab.SPOOL_AWAIT_MS]. A clock jump moves no round by itself: `manager.refreshRelays()` is the poke
 * that makes a worker look now. A scope a scenario waits more than a minute for is a missing hook.

     * its **next ask**, once whichever plane hands them to us has — and is never pushed them. The push #53 added
     * (ADR 2026-09.ywzn's wanter drain) could not tell an asker that still lacks the bytes from one whose copy
     * is already arriving from somebody else, and in a clique it bought every recipient a copy per neighbour.
     * The asker re-asks on its own 60 s tick while it still lacks them (`rewantMissingBlobs`, ADR 2026-09.ptv8),
     * so the wait is a minute at most, not the half hour #53 saw.
     *
     * Carol is the asker and holds the frame only as a carrier: she is linked to Bob alone, has no relay, and
     * Alice is off the radios entirely, so Bob is the one node that can ever hand her these bytes. The relay
     * starts out as a frames-only one (no attachment limits in its HELLO, so a conforming client sends it no
     * attachment record at all), which is what makes the order the case needs a fact rather than a race:
     * Carol necessarily asks while the picture exists nowhere but on Alice. Growing the support mid-run —
     * the spool re-advertises on the next dial — is what lands the bytes on Bob; the re-link is Carol's tick.

     * scenario must have an attachment pending while the peers are linked or no sighting is ever recorded.
     * An **avatar** is the one reference that can stamp it without deferring anything itself: it writes no

     *
     * The clock jump is `ACK_GRACE_MS` (issue #46), and it is what leaves this scenario asking one question.
     * A frame younger than the grace defers on the sighting alone, because no ack could have come back yet;
