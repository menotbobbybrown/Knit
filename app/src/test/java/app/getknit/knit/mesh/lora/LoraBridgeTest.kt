/**
 * The two-pocket bridge (ADR 044), end to end on the JVM.
 *
 * The scenario the plane exists for: two groups of phones, each meshed over BLE/NAN, too far apart to see
 * each other, with one board-holder in each. Both boards hear each other over LoRa. In this rig the LoRa
 * "air" reaches everyone (that is the whole point — the boards ARE in range); what separates the pockets is
 * `onForeignReachable`, which the composite transport populates only from short-range siblings and which
 * therefore means exactly "who is in my BLE/NAN clique". A board-less pocket member needs no transport here:
 * it exists only as a name in that set.
