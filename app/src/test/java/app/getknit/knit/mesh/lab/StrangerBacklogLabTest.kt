/**
 * A carrier hands a newcomer the backlog of someone the newcomer has never met (ADR 2026-09.9xuu). The
 * newcomer can verify none of it until the author's key arrives, and its router marks every frame seen on the
 * way in, so a frame the park turns away is deduped for the whole ten-minute seen window — on Bluetooth the
 * carrier does not even re-write it (`LinkCrossings`). With a park of sixteen per sender that left most of a
 * backlog undelivered, and out of the newcomer's custody, for ten minutes (found by the iOS port on a Moto G: 41
 * frames outstanding, 16 parked). Two things close it, and each scenario pins one: the carrier serves profiles
 * ahead of everything else, and a newcomer that meets the backlog keyless anyway parks all of it to replay.
 *
 * A carrier whose custody has lost the author's profile, and whose process has restarted since it pinned them,
 * still holds the signed frame that pin came from (ADR 2026-09.g64k; found by the iOS port on a Pixel 3: 81
 * frames no fresh peer could read). The key goes ahead of the backlog from there, and a key request is answered
 * from there too; the last two scenarios pin one each.
 *
 * Nothing here moves the lab calendar: the old behaviour converged only once the seen window had lapsed.
