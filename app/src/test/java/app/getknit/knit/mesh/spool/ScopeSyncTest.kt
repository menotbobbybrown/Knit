/**
 * The plane end to end, two members over one in-process spool: §9.1's bidirectional heal, §9.3's
 * invalid-set quarantine, §9.2's outward dead-on-arrival guard, and §9.4's bridge into mesh delivery.
 *
 * This is the correctness oracle for the milestone — the device bench proves the socket, this proves
 * the protocol. Virtual time is stepped rather than drained (`advanceUntilIdle` would never return: the
 * supervisor, the per-spool worker and the tick loop are all deliberately infinite).
