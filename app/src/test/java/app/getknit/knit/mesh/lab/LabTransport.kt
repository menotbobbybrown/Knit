/**
 * The in-process radio behind a [LabNode]: a [MeshTransport] whose links are other [LabTransport]s in the same
 * JVM. What it adds over `FakeLoopTransport` (which the single-SUT rigs use) is a **directed, holdable pipe per
 * link**: a scenario can [hold] what one side sends the other and [release] it in an order of its choosing,
 * which is how "custody serves the two in either order" becomes a deterministic case rather than a lucky one.
 *
 * **Bare, it is a link plane with no fast plane** — the Bluetooth plane before its side channel: every
 * originated frame floods once over `send(wire, null)`, every custody re-serve unicasts over
 * `send(wire, peer)`, and `fastFanout`/`fastSend` are the interface's no-ops.
 *
 * **With [pages] it is the Bluetooth plane as shipped** (ADR 2026-09.sjaa): [hasFastPlane], and the fast path
 * routes through the real `BleFastRoutePolicy` — [fastFanout] is the link copy to every linked peer (through
 * the same pipe as the flood, held and lost with it: one L2CAP stream) plus a page on the [LabPages] every
 * member in range hears, arriving from the frame's *author*; [fastSend] is the linked addressee over its
 * pipe and never a page. A node joins the pages the way it takes a board (`MeshLab.node(pages = …)`).
 *
 * Either way a pipe carries a frame **once**, through the same [LinkCrossings] the phone's transport keeps:
 * the flood copy and the fast path's link copy are one write, a frame that just came in is never handed back
 * over the pipe it came by, and what the memo skipped is in [dupSkipped]. Before it, every `shouldFastFanout`
 * frame crossed a real L2CAP link twice and the far end's SeenSet ate the second.
