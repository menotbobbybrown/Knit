/**
 * Populates the database with a believable conversation history so the app renders fully on an
 * emulator — used only by the static demo-screenshot build (`-PseedDemo=true`; the field defaults false,
 * so this never runs in normal/release builds, and it is skipped when the animated `-PdemoDirector` is on,
 * which seeds its own baseline). The concrete content (cast, messages, group) comes from a [DemoScenario]
 * chosen by `-PdemoTheme` (see [demoScenarioFor]), so we can shoot multiple marketing themes from one code.
 *
 * The actual writes go through [DemoWriter], the shared primitives the animated [DemoDirector] also uses,
 * so both stay in lockstep. Paired with [app.getknit.knit.mesh.DemoTransport], which reports
 * [ONLINE_NODE_IDS] as connected so the "connected" header and contact "online" dots light up. All writes
 * are idempotent upserts keyed by stable ids, so a relaunch re-seeds deterministically.
 *
 * Beyond the conversation history it arms the two **planes** the emulator cannot actually run — the
 * Internet relays and the LoRa board, via [DemoPlanes] — because both are now visible all over the UI (a
 * globe or a board glyph on a chat header, a bubble and a ✓✓ tick, two settings screens), and without them
 * every capture of that surface would be of its off state. Binding the board also brings up the **Meshtastic
 * room**, whose history is seeded here for the same reason ([DemoWriter.seedMeshRoom]).
