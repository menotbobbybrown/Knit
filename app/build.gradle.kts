// It is the one part of the release build that depends on a tool outside the Gradle/AGP pin — the NDK's
// llvm-objcopy/llvm-strip — and AGP degrades SILENTLY when the NDK is absent (it warns and ships the
// prebuilt .so unstripped). That makes the output bytes a function of the *build machine*, which breaks
// the F-Droid reproducible-build contract: F-Droid rebuilds this commit on their buildserver — which has
// no NDK, and no `ndk:` line in .fdroid.yml — and byte-compares against the APK we publish, so "stripped
// here, unstripped there" is a verification failure.
//
// Hence the split rather than a global default. Symbols ride in the AAB's BUNDLE-METADATA and never enter
// an APK, so turning them on for `bundle*` costs the APK nothing, while `assembleRelease` stays NDK-free
// and byte-identical on every machine (see packaging.jniLibs below). Keying off the requested task is what
// makes that automatic: the Play AAB is cut by hand, and 2.2.2/vc11 shipped to open testing with **zero**
// debug symbols because the flag was forgotten — the silent-degradation failure mode, one level up.
